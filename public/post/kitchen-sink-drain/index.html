<p>While a bathroom sink&rsquo;s design and overall size may vary from one model to the next, the drain holes are fairly standard, 1.25 inches being a general standard, with widths of 1.5 inches and 1.625 inches also common. The size of the hole helps determine which size drain is needed for that particular sink.</p>
