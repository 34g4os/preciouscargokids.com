<p>Adhesive Hooks For a heavier clock, use more than one hook in order to help share the load and spread out the weight evenly. Often they come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but a simple plastic or metal hook will do fine. You peel the protective paper from the back of the hook and then press it onto the wall.Dec 9, 2017</p>

<p>We recommend using a screw instead of any type of hanger. Hanging the clock without a stud. A zip wall anchor is the easiest, yet the strongest way to go if you have to use your sheetrock and cannot find a stud (studs are best to use).Oct 7, 2010</p>

<p>Generally speaking, no more than two-thirds to three-quarters of the wall space should be covered. This allows you to space out each piece and avoid visual clutter. If a wall is nearing this limit or already has multiple statement pieces, you&rsquo;ll need to select a smaller clock or clear some of the current artwork.Oct 29, 2020</p>

<p>Spots to consider hanging a clock would be above a mantle, near a desk in a study or in the home&rsquo;s entryway. The ideal ratio for artwork on a wall is that it should cover about 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the wall space.May 13, 2020</p>

<p>With a large clock, it&rsquo;s easy to keep the clock as the main focus. A good idea is a small mirror on either side, or pictures of loved ones framing the corners around the clock. That way, when you look for the time, you aren&rsquo;t distracted and you can catch a glimpse of something dear to your heart.Jul 5, 2018</p>

<p>But as Pinterest notes, horology (the study of time) is making a major impact on style and home décor in 2022. 1 While this trend isn&rsquo;t quite new—big wall clocks were popular in the early and mid-2000s, too—contemporary applications are moving beyond the farmhouse chic clock look of years past.Mar 24, 2022</p>

<p>Going Commando: You can also hang a clock on a wall with nothing around it. A wall like this can&rsquo;t be too long otherwise even a large clock will look out of place (because let&rsquo;s face it, most large clocks need a little support…)Sep 20, 2018</p>

<p>If you have an oversized clock, especially one with hanging pendulums, above eye level is the place to be. This helps balance the room&rsquo;s visual weight and keeps your clock from dominating the rest of your decor. In addition to height, where you hang your wall clock is also important to consider.Apr 9, 2021</p>

<p>In this regard, size does matter and going too big or too small can make your walls look crowded and cluttered or too sparse and mismatched. Generally, a clock will be between six to eighteen inches (about 15 cm to 45 cm).May 13, 2020</p>
