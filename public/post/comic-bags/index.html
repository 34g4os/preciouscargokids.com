Mylar storage options are more expensive than poly options, however they last significantly longer, with claims you will not have to change the bag for 150 years!Nov 13, 2016\nDo comics deteriorate? Comics are/were unfortunately not made to last, usually constructed from cheaper paper which contains impurities that will speed up the process of degradation. There are things you can do to slow this process significantly, but incorrect storage will only serve to speed the damage up.\nShould you bag comics? You don’t need to bag your comics. I have about thirty long boxes and my books aren’t bagged. Bagging was created to put a price on the comic without writing on it.Feb 11, 2014\nAre polypropylene comic bags good?

I’ve bought collections both bagged and unbagged.Feb 11, 2014\nShould I open bagged comics? The most immediate issue with books in polybags is that the back side of the bag has a seam.

Basically: Unbag all comics before sending them to CGC – if for no other reason than because many polybagged comics require a press to remove a sealing crease. Remove any unattached associated items.Apr 18, 2019\nDo bags and boards protect comics? The bag and board are the primary way that comic book collectors protect and store their treasured possessions. Without these simple devices, a comic book will simply be destroyed by the elements, as comic books are usually made of fairly flimsy paper.Jul 22, 2018\nShould you bag and board comics?

Blinds or curtains work wonders in knocking down most of the intruding light but if you want to take an extra step of precaution or you do not want to keep the blinds closed all the time you can purchase clear or tinted window film that applies to your homes windows that will block 98% of damaging UV rays from passing …Sep 26, 2019\nDo you need backing boards for comics?

To have a poly-bagged book certified by CGC, you must either remove the book from its poly-bag or send written approval authorizing CGC to remove it.
