<p>Probably the easiest way is to use a self-adhesive seal strip. Another method is to attach a plastic sheet to the bottom of the door with some water-resistant adhesive tape. You can get better results if you combine seal strips with plastic sheets. Instead of a plastic sheet, you can use waterproof seal tape.Apr 7, 2022</p>
