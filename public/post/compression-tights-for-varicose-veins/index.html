<p>If you&rsquo;re shopping for a compression sock without a prescription, you will likely want either the 8-15 mmHg or 15-20 mmHg compression level. This level of compression is usually sufficient to treat the most common issues like achiness, swelling, tiredness, and mild varicose veins in the legs.Jun 15, 2020</p>
<h2 id="what-does-20-30-mmhg-mean-in-compression-stockings">What does 20-30 mmHg mean in compression stockings?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-does-20-30-mmhg-mean-in-compression-stockings">#</a></h2>
<p>Compression levels are indicated with a range of numbers like “20-30 mmHg”, which means that the amount of compression will not fall below 20 mmHg and not exceed 30 mmHg. The unit of measurement is called “millimeters of mercury” which is a measurement of pressure, also used in blood pressure.Jul 10, 2020</p>

<p>15-20 mmHg: Great for daily wear, travel, and sports. They help improve circulation without being too tight. 20-30 mmHg: Great for sports recovery, daily wear, medical recovery, and to manage mild symptoms of varicose and spider veins. Ideal for patients looking for more support.</p>

<p>The general rule of thumb is to ask yourself where the affected area is on your legs. If you have swelling only in your ankles, then a knee high sock should be sufficient. If you have swelling on or above the knee, consider a thigh high or pantyhose / waist high compression stocking.Apr 17, 2015</p>

<p>Outlook. Compression stockings may not eliminate varicose veins, but they may reduce associated pain and swelling. Examine their legs daily for signs of irritation and damage, and replace compression stockings every 3 to 6 months. Keep the legs and stockings clean and dry to achieve the best results.</p>

<p>Overusing compression socks and wearing them incorrectly can break your skin and create conditions where an infection can start. You shouldn&rsquo;t leave the same pair of compression socks on for days at a time, and you should ask a doctor about the length of wear time recommended for treating your symptoms.May 22, 2020</p>

<p>Is it safe to wear compression socks all day? The simple answer is yes, absolutely! If you have poor circulation, pain or soreness in your legs and feet, or have a job that requires you to be standing or even sitting all day, then it may be time to explore wearing graduated compression socks.Feb 14, 2021</p>

You should be given at least 2 stockings, or 2 pairs if you&rsquo;re wearing them on both legs. This means you can wear 1 stocking (or pair) while the other is being washed and dried.</p>
