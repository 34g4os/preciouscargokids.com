DEALING WITH PAIN In conjunction with R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), moderate or severe ankle sprains may need to be immobilized in a splint or brace for a few weeks immediately after the injury. Simply walking around can aggravate a sprained ankle.\nShould I wear an ankle brace all day? If you are using your ankle brace as a rehabilitative or treatment device you should wear your brace while performing any daily activities to provide more stability and prevent re-injury.\nHow many hours a day should you wear an ankle brace? Typically, this takes 2-3 practices for athletes or wearing for 4-6 hours for non-athletes. Once the brace has an opportunity to adjust to the shape of your ankle it will be very comfortable to wear and fit in the shoe much easier. Here are additional fitting tips to ensure a comfortable fit.\nCan an ankle brace make it worse? Overuse of an ankle brace can be bad for you because it can affect your ankle strength and balance. If the ankle doesn’t have to do the work for balance and support, then it gets weaker, increasing the risk of injury.Sep 27, 2018\nHow long should you wear ankle support? If you happen to step on an uneven surface or lose your balance, your ankle is held in proper position. Physicians often recommend that you wear a brace during activities for up to 12 months after an ankle sprain.\nHow many hours a day should you wear an ankle brace? Typically, this takes 2-3 practices for athletes or wearing for 4-6 hours for non-athletes. Once the brace has an opportunity to adjust to the shape of your ankle it will be very comfortable to wear and fit in the shoe much easier. Here are additional fitting tips to ensure a comfortable fit.\nIs it good to wear ankle support? Using ankle braces to prevent ankle injuries is becoming more common, and I’m often asked by coaches, parents and athletes if wearing an ankle brace is worthwhile. Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity.Jan 9, 2017\nHow long should you wear an ankle compression sleeve? Ankle compression sleeves are to be worn in a period spanning from 10 days to 6 weeks. They really benefit athletes by helping them train while injured and help get them back out on the field sooner.\nDo ankle braces make your ankles weak? Will ankle braces cause my ankles to weaken? There is no evidence that suggests that ankle bracing weakens the ankle. Our ankle braces are not engineered to be so restrictive that the ankle cannot function on it’s own. The brace is only there for a support.\nHow long should you wear an ankle brace for? If you happen to step on an uneven surface or lose your balance, your ankle is held in proper position. Physicians often recommend that you wear a brace during activities for up to 12 months after an ankle sprain.\nShould I wear ankle brace all day? If you are using your ankle brace as a rehabilitative or treatment device you should wear your brace while performing any daily activities to provide more stability and prevent re-injury.\nIs ankle taping or bracing better? Most have shown that braces are slightly more effective than taping but that both are better than no support at all. One study found that simply wearing high-top sneakers instead of low-tops prevented some ankle injuries and that high-tops plus taping had more than 50% fewer injuries than low-tops plus taping.\nDo ankle braces help weak ankles? Brace for it: When to use an ankle brace Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity. Ankle braces are not shown to reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower extremity injuries.Jan 9, 2017\nAre ankle braces good for ankles? Using an ankle brace helps improve blood circulation and reduce swelling in your ankles and feet. It alleviates pain and provides your feet the extra support it needs to heal quickly.Mar 21, 2022\nDo ankle braces make you weaker? Myth #3: Wearing ankle braces promotes ankle weakness “There is a misconception that if you wear a brace you don’t need to use the ankle as much, so people come to the conclusion without evidence that they will lose the strength; however, no studies have proven this.”\nWhat is the best support for weak ankles? Protect. If you feel the instability daily through walking or standing, wearing an ankle brace can help support your weak ankles. The Trizone Ankle Sleeve is recommended for daily use. If you are looking to stay active and play sports, we recommend an ankle brace that provides moderate protection.\n",

<p>DEALING WITH PAIN In conjunction with R.I.C.E. (rest, ice, compression, and elevation), moderate or severe ankle sprains may need to be immobilized in a splint or brace for a few weeks immediately after the injury. Simply walking around can aggravate a sprained ankle.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-wear-an-ankle-brace-all-day">Should I wear an ankle brace all day?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#should-i-wear-an-ankle-brace-all-day">#</a></h2>
<p>If you are using your ankle brace as a rehabilitative or treatment device you should wear your brace while performing any daily activities to provide more stability and prevent re-injury.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-hours-a-day-should-you-wear-an-ankle-brace">How many hours a day should you wear an ankle brace?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-many-hours-a-day-should-you-wear-an-ankle-brace">#</a></h2>
<p>Typically, this takes 2-3 practices for athletes or wearing for 4-6 hours for non-athletes. Once the brace has an opportunity to adjust to the shape of your ankle it will be very comfortable to wear and fit in the shoe much easier. Here are additional fitting tips to ensure a comfortable fit.</p>

<p>Overuse of an ankle brace can be bad for you because it can affect your ankle strength and balance. If the ankle doesn&rsquo;t have to do the work for balance and support, then it gets weaker, increasing the risk of injury.Sep 27, 2018</p>
<h2 id="how-long-should-you-wear-ankle-support">How long should you wear ankle support?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-long-should-you-wear-ankle-support">#</a></h2>
<p>If you happen to step on an uneven surface or lose your balance, your ankle is held in proper position. Physicians often recommend that you wear a brace during activities for up to 12 months after an ankle sprain.</p>

<p>Using ankle braces to prevent ankle injuries is becoming more common, and I&rsquo;m often asked by coaches, parents and athletes if wearing an ankle brace is worthwhile. Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity.Jan 9, 2017</p>

<p>Ankle compression sleeves are to be worn in a period spanning from 10 days to 6 weeks. They really benefit athletes by helping them train while injured and help get them back out on the field sooner.</p>
<h2 id="do-ankle-braces-make-your-ankles-weak">Do ankle braces make your ankles weak?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#do-ankle-braces-make-your-ankles-weak">#</a></h2>
<p>Will ankle braces cause my ankles to weaken? There is no evidence that suggests that ankle bracing weakens the ankle. Our ankle braces are not engineered to be so restrictive that the ankle cannot function on it&rsquo;s own. The brace is only there for a support.</p>

<h2 id="is-ankle-taping-or-bracing-better">Is ankle taping or bracing better?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-ankle-taping-or-bracing-better">#</a></h2>
<p>Most have shown that braces are slightly more effective than taping but that both are better than no support at all. One study found that simply wearing high-top sneakers instead of low-tops prevented some ankle injuries and that high-tops plus taping had more than 50% fewer injuries than low-tops plus taping.</p>

<p>Brace for it: When to use an ankle brace Current research indicates ankle brace use in high school-aged athletes lowers the incidence of acute ankle injuries, but not the severity. Ankle braces are not shown to reduce the severity of ankle, knee or other lower extremity injuries.Jan 9, 2017</p>

<p>Using an ankle brace helps improve blood circulation and reduce swelling in your ankles and feet. It alleviates pain and provides your feet the extra support it needs to heal quickly.Mar 21, 2022</p>

<p>Myth #3: Wearing ankle braces promotes ankle weakness “There is a misconception that if you wear a brace you don&rsquo;t need to use the ankle as much, so people come to the conclusion without evidence that they will lose the strength; however, no studies have proven this.”</p>

<p>Protect. If you feel the instability daily through walking or standing, wearing an ankle brace can help support your weak ankles. The Trizone Ankle Sleeve is recommended for daily use. If you are looking to stay active and play sports, we recommend an ankle brace that provides moderate protection.</p>
