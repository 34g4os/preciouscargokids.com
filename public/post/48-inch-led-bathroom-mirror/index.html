<p>Is Investing in Lighted Bathroom Mirrors Worth It? LED Bathroom mirrors are well worth the investment. LED lights are used in the mirrors, which are long-lasting and sturdy. In addition, they provide illumination in the bathroom, making your daily tasks easier.Dec 21, 2021</p>

<p>LEDs are also the most energy-efficient way of lighting a mirror, saving you money off your energy bill and doing your bit for the environment at the same time. They also have a far superior lifespan. The average LED has a lifespan of roughly 50,000 hours, some 42 times longer than a traditional incandescent bulb.Sep 13, 2017</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re An Even Source Of Lighting Backlit mirrors won&rsquo;t cast shadows on you because they emit an even amount of light all around you. This makes them great for applying makeup, shaving, or styling your hair because it allows you to see yourself clearly without the shadows cast by traditional overhead lighting.Sep 4, 2016</p>

<p>It really comes down to magnification. Since concave mirrors focus light inward and magnify the object (aka your face), it allows you to better see your skin, eyes, and lips when applying makeup. Seeing your face more clearly and in more detail will help you to get a precise and even application.</p>

<p>The most common way to determine your mirror size is choose a mirror that is 1-2 inches shorter than the width of the countertop of your bathroom vanity. Many also prefer to keep the mirror flush with the vanity, which is a matter of preference.Jan 4, 2019</p>
<h2 id="should-mirror-be-same-width-as-vanity">Should mirror be same width as vanity?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#should-mirror-be-same-width-as-vanity">#</a></h2>
<p>A bathroom mirror over the vanity should be wider than the sink but 2-6 inches narrower than the vanity. The bathroom mirror size should allow it to hang without touching the vanity, backsplash, light fixtures, wall mounts, ceiling, and adjacent walls.</p>

<p>A general rule would be NOT to fit your vanity&rsquo;s size. Have a few inches inside your vanity or go over it if possible. A mirror fitting your vanity&rsquo;s size will create two long straight lines on both sides which is not recommended. If you go inside, make sure the mirror&rsquo;s frame do not finish too close to you sink.</p>

<p>Vanity Restrictions to Mirror Height Ideally, the mirror should be mounted a few inches higher than the tallest point of your vanity faucet, or between 5 to 10 inches above the bathroom sink. You also need to account for your bathroom light fixtures.</p>
