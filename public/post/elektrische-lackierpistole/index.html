Both whole and ground white pepper are available.Jul 19, 2021\nWhat’s the difference between white pepper and red pepper? each fruit (peppercorn) turns black after about three days of drying…” If, however, the fruit is allowed to ripen completely, it will then turn fully red, after which the outer covering is removed, revealing a white center, which is left as a peppercorn or ground into white pepper.May 30, 2014\nCan I substitute white pepper for red pepper? In A Hurry? The best substitute for white pepper is black pepper. As an alternative, you can also substitute white pepper with red peppercorn, green peppercorn, or pepper spice blend.
