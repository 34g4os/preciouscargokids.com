<p>In general, flamed tealights go 4-6 hours, flamed votives 15-20 hours and flamed pillars above 100 hours.

<p>Even though a tea light candle is smaller than a normal candle, it still can burn for a long time, and as it burns, the wick will become long. A long wick leads to a larger flame, which is more hazardous than a small flame, and a large flame burns the candle faster.</p>
