Beginners cymbal packs normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. A few contain only three cymbals, using a crash/ride instead of the separate ride and crash.\nWhat are the drum symbols called?

<p>The basic cymbals include the large ride cymbal, the crash cymbal-which is used for accents-and the hi-hat, with its two stacked cymbals whose degree of separation can be controlled to prolong or shorten the sound of the cymbals.</p>

<p>Beginners cymbal packs normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. A few contain only three cymbals, using a crash/ride instead of the separate ride and crash.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-drum-symbols-called">What are the drum symbols called?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-are-the-drum-symbols-called">#</a></h2>
<p>Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride, or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist.</p>

<p>The drum kit may be loosely divided into four parts: Breakables: Sticks, various cymbals, snare drum, throne (stool) and sometimes the bass drum pedal. Shells: Bass drum and toms. Extensions: Cowbell, tambourine, chimes, any other instrument not part of the standard kit.</p>

<p>Though there is no original standard configuration for drum kits, drum kits have a five-piece set, including two tom-toms, a floor tom, a bass drum, and a snare drum. The floor tom is a tom-tom that has a stand or legs and sits on the floor.</p>

<p>In most anything but a barebones drum kit, you&rsquo;re going to have four cymbals: the hi hat on the far left, the ride cymbal on the right, and two crash cymbals above, left and right. So it&rsquo;s completely natural to have a crash cymbal on your upper right.Sep 9, 2011</p>

<p>Most modern kits usually have at least one or two crash cymbals. They can be played with sticks, your hands, or mallets to produce a wide range of tonal colors. Rock drummers sometimes hit two crashes at the same for an extra-powerful accent.Nov 10, 2019</p>

<p>Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride, or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat cymbals. A player of cymbals is known as a cymbalist.</p>

<p>Cymbals share an equal role among the drums. They are obsessed over and influence techniques as much as the snare drum, and there are several different types of cymbals that could complete your drum set. The most common types of cymbals include the ride, hi-hats, crash, splash, China, and effects.</p>

<p>Though there is no original standard configuration for drum kits, drum kits have a five-piece set, including two tom-toms, a floor tom, a bass drum, and a snare drum. The floor tom is a tom-tom that has a stand or legs and sits on the floor.</p>
