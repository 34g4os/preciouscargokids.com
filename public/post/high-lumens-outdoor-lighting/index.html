                2 Installation Ways: JACKYLED solar dusk to dawn light can be installed in two ways—with or without the extension cord—to better meet your lighting needs. The extension cord makes it possible to install the LED lamp panel in a sunless place where you need light, and the solar panel can be installed where it can charge more sunlight. (Note: This solar security light has no motion sensor.) Charge Faster &amp; Work Longer: With a 5.5V 3.5W wider polycrystalline silicon solar panel, JACKYLED outdoor solar porch light can absorb more sunlight in the daytime. The ultra-large 5500mAh battery can power the LED solar light for up to 6-12 hours, working all night. Kind reminder: The actual working time and required charging time is affected by the intensity of the sunlight. Super Bright: Built-in with 48 ultra bright LED beads, our solar powered spotlight is brighter than others, with an illumination range of 120° at up to 1000 lumens. The LED lamp panel can be rotated horizontally to fit your needs for lighting different angles. Durable &amp; Water Resistant: Made of high-strength ABS&#43;PC material, the solar flood light is rated IP65 waterproof, and can withstand rain, wind, snow, ice and wet conditions. Perfect for any outdoor location, such as the front door, back yard, porch, patio, barn, garage, pathway, driveway, etc. Easy to Install: After installing the bracket, you only need to screw in the butterfly nut to install it. When you don t need it or in tornado weathers, just remove the LED lamp panel and solar panel, and leave the bracket on the wall for re-installation.
