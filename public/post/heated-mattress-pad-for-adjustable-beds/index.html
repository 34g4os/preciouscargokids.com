                PERFECTLY PLACED PLUG WON’T POKE YOU AT NIGHT: 12.5FT POWER CORD gives you plenty of reach to any nearby outlet, allowing you to place our pad on top mattress without fear of not reaching a wall outlet. YOU ALSO WON’T EVEN FEEL IT’S THERE because of our plump stuffed padding. The conveniently placed 6ft dual controller cords can easily be reached and tucked away as well. PROTECT SKIN FROM BURNS &amp; RADIATION: MOST COMPETITORS DON’T MENTION how harmful amounts of electromagnetic radiation can be transmitted through the heating process in most heated bed warmers. NOT IN OURS. AT Degree of Comfort, we engineered our heated mattress pads to heat up with barely any EMF radiation being dispensed. Also, our mattress pads are 100% UL SAFETY CERTIFIED. HEAT ONE SIDE &amp; STAY COOL THE OTHER: BOTH SPOUSES CAN CUSTOMIZE their side of the bed’s temperature! 2 Individual Dual controllers (queen, king, cal king sizes only) give each person the power to choose their own heating preference. Allowing you to be QUICKLY HEATED FROM THE BOTTOM UP or quickly cool down as you wish. THERAPEUTIC HEAT RELIEF: ACHES &amp; PAINS MELT AWAY – steady heat dilates blood vessels and promotes blood flow. This helps to  open up  sore muscles and joints to relax them. Our heated pad is PERFECT FOR people suffering from multiple muscle pain OR PEOPLE WITH A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOB. Also, if you’re iron deficient and just need the extra warmth! SATISFACTION GUARANTEED: 5 YEAR WARRANTY – WE KNOW YOU’RE TIRED OF buying inferior electric mattress pads that stop working in only the first few uses. That’s why we engineered our heated mattress pad to last all year round even through the most restless sleepers!

                [10-level Adjustable Temperature] This bottom blanket has 10 temperature settings, and  1~10  indicates the setting levels of different temperatures. Users can set different temperature levels according to their own needs to the greatest extent. The bottom blanket measures 39 x75  inches and is suitable for single use. [UL Certification &amp; Timer Shutdown] The blanket has UL safety certification and a timer shutdown function. You can choose 1-10 hours  timing time, and the controller will turn off the heating when time is up. The timer function offers you a good-night sleep. Besides, there is NTC partial overheating protection. If the blanket temperature rises due to partial misfolding, the controller will activate the NTC protection to limit the temperature so that the blanket is not easily damaged. [Preheat Function] Press the Preheat button when the blanket is turned on, set the temperature to the highest level, and set it back to the original level after heating for 1 hour. In that case, you can enjoy the warmth quickly and reduce the waiting time for heating. Heating filaments are evenly distributed inside the blanket for optimum comfort. [Skin-friendly Coral Fleece &amp; Machine Washable] The surface of the blanket is made of soft coral fleece material, which is skin-friendly and breathable. It can be directly contacted by human skin without burdening the skin. Besides, the bottom blanket is washable by machine or hand. Simply remove the controller then the entire heating blanket can be washed in the machine. Let the blanket dry naturally to keep it clean and soft. [Deep Pocket Design] The side of the blanket is designed with elastic wrapping, which directly wraps your mattress in four directions so that the blanket will not slide when you sleep. You can rollover as you like to improve sleep quality.

<p>It&rsquo;s completely safe to use your electric blanket with either a memory foam mattress or a memory foam mattress cover. Most modern blankets have safety features such as an overheat protection system, so they&rsquo;ll never get hot enough to risk your safety.Dec 4, 2019</p>

<p>Using a heated mattress pad is a convenient way to keep warm overnight during colder months. They are typically safe to use, but they may not be suitable for people with certain health conditions, such as diabetic neuropathy. They offer potential health benefits, such as improved sleep quality and pain relief.</p>

<p>Take heed! According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI), heating pads and electric blankets are responsible for causing approximately 500 fires each year. A majority of these fires involve electric blankets that are more than ten years old.</p>

<p>We do not recommend using an electric blanket or heating pad with your mattress. Due to the temperature-sensitivity of the TEMPUR material, adding high heat can hinder its ability to react to your body temperature and conform to your body shape.</p>

<p>Tempting as it may be to warm your memory foam mattress as quickly as possible with a hot water bottle or electric blanket/heating pad, we advise you not to do so. Such direct applications of heat can damage the memory foam material and not only compromise its performance but also shorten its overall lifespan.Oct 19, 2018</p>
<h2 id="can-you-use-a-heated-mattress-pad-with-a-memory-foam-mattress">Can you use a heated mattress pad with a memory foam mattress?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-you-use-a-heated-mattress-pad-with-a-memory-foam-mattress">#</a></h2>
<p>Memory foam mattresses respond to temperature. This property allows the foam to mold to the shape of your body, but it also means heating pads may damage the mattress if used directly on top of the foam. Similarly, avoid electric blankets and heated mattress pads on memory foam mattresses.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-warm-up-a-tempurpedic-mattress">How do you warm up a tempurpedic mattress?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-you-warm-up-a-tempurpedic-mattress">#</a></h2>
<p>The cover solves the heat problem for many people but for many others, it doesn&rsquo;t. If the Tempur-Pedic mattress sleeps hot even with the cover on, use an additional pad or cover over it to insulate the mattress from the body. The thicker the insulation, the longer it takes body heat to reach the Tempur foam layer.</p>

<p>A. We do not recommend the use of electric blankets or hot water bottles when sleeping on a TEMPUR mattress. Because TEMPUR material responds to your body heat, an electric blanket or hot water bottle will prevent it from doing this and properly contouring to your shape.</p>
