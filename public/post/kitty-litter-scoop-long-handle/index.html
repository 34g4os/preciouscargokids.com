One of two things will happen: they’ll go somewhere else, or they’ll hold it in until the box is clean. If they do the latter, that can lead to some serious issues, like a UTI, bladder infection, or kidney problems. For humans, bladder issues are obnoxious, but not too serious. For cats, they’re a big deal.May 20, 2018\nHow often should you scoop a litterbox? How Often Should You Change the Cat Litter? If you use a clumping litter, it’s best to scoop the box daily and change it out completely at least monthly. If you have more than one cat, it may be best to change the cat litter more often, every 2-3 weeks.\nIs it OK to clean litter box once a week? Typically, cat parents wash the box once a week. You can use dish soap and warm water or vinegar and water to clean the box. Don’t use traditional bleach since it can interact with the ammonia in cat urine. Regular washing will prevent the plastic material of your litter box from absorbing cat odors.\nHow many times should a cat use the litter box a day? Some cats will “hold it” and urinate as infrequently as possible to avoid stepping into a dirty, filthy, full litter box. Instead of urinating two to three times a day, your cat will tighten up and only go once a day.\n",

                No More Back-breaking Scooping --- Our durable scoop gives you 32” (81.3 cm) keeping you from bending over and hurting your back. That’s twice the length of most scoopers and if you don’t want or need that extra length, you can use the 16” (40.6 cm) handle with comfort grip without the 16” (40.6 cm) extender. No More Hand Fatigue --- Arthritis? Carpal tunnel? Hand cramps? Maintaining the cat litter box is not fun. That’s why SunGrow has thoughtfully added a comfort grip at the end of the scooper and at the end of the 16” (40.6 cm) scooper extender handle. This means you will always enjoy a sure and easy grip. Clumps Slide Off! --- Our aluminum scoop with 5.5mm wide slots each stops clumps from sticking and it won’t rust, hold odors, or break. It works well with non-clumping, wheat, walnut shells, paper litter, and more. SunGrow’s scoop is the best and last scoop you’ll ever need. Get Finished Faster --- Spend more time playing and engaging with your cat because our wide scoop 4.7” (12 cm) will let you speed through box cleaning. It’s purrfect for multi-cat homes letting you clear multiple boxes faster while catching all the clumps and saving clear litter. Purrfect For Walker And Wheelchair Users --- SunGrow’s 32” (81.3 cm) handle supports use for persons using wheelchairs and walkers. It’s also helpful for temporary concerns such as hip replacement, sprains, and knee replacement. Everyone can benefit from our handle extender and comfort grip scooper.

<p>One of two things will happen: they&rsquo;ll go somewhere else, or they&rsquo;ll hold it in until the box is clean. If they do the latter, that can lead to some serious issues, like a UTI, bladder infection, or kidney problems. For humans, bladder issues are obnoxious, but not too serious. For cats, they&rsquo;re a big deal.May 20, 2018</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-scoop-a-litterbox">How often should you scoop a litterbox?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-often-should-you-scoop-a-litterbox">#</a></h2>
<p>How Often Should You Change the Cat Litter? If you use a clumping litter, it&rsquo;s best to scoop the box daily and change it out completely at least monthly. If you have more than one cat, it may be best to change the cat litter more often, every 2-3 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-ok-to-clean-litter-box-once-a-week">Is it OK to clean litter box once a week?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-it-ok-to-clean-litter-box-once-a-week">#</a></h2>
<p>Typically, cat parents wash the box once a week. You can use dish soap and warm water or vinegar and water to clean the box. Don&rsquo;t use traditional bleach since it can interact with the ammonia in cat urine. Regular washing will prevent the plastic material of your litter box from absorbing cat odors.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-times-should-a-cat-use-the-litter-box-a-day">How many times should a cat use the litter box a day?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-many-times-should-a-cat-use-the-litter-box-a-day">#</a></h2>
<p>Some cats will “hold it” and urinate as infrequently as possible to avoid stepping into a dirty, filthy, full litter box. Instead of urinating two to three times a day, your cat will tighten up and only go once a day.</p>
