<p>Light the first candle and hold it horizontally so the flame is about one inch over the mouth of the bottle. Tilt the candle so a few drops of wax drip onto the mouth of the bottle. Quickly, while the wax is still warm, turn the candle right side up and place it into the mouth of the bottle.</p>

<p>Candles drip because wax melts. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. When a wick is lit, the heat from the flame melts a path through the candle&rsquo;s body of wax. When too much wax melts at once, it can spill over the side of the candle and drip.</p>

<p>The best way to protect your table linens or tabletop is to place a barrier between it and your candles. One way to achieve this is to place any candle holders on top of a mirror. Its surface would not only be easier to clean, it can also provide a lovely reflection of the candlelight.Oct 8, 2020</p>

<p>Use a single hole punch to punch a hole in the center of your paper circle. Cut eight ½&quot; slits from the center of the hole. Slide the top of your wax candle through the bottom of the slitted hole so that the drip protector sits about halfway up the candle.Mar 10, 2017</p>
