                ✅ An ankle brace that moves with you: Invest in an ankle support that will last. Zenith has developed a brace with the end user in mind. Made from the highest quality nylon and neoprene, you will get the best possible support and breathability. Double stitched seams also mean you will not have to keep spending your money on new braces every month! ✅ Ankle pain, be gone: Proven to reduce or eliminate ankle pain caused by sprains, tendonitis and other acute injuries. Our brace is designed to be used for healing and prevention of sports related injuries as well as minor accidents. The side straps contour your ankle to immobilize the foot without restricting your ability to walk or run. ✅ Stay on your feet: We specifically made this brace to perform well in ANY activity, including: volleyball, basketball, hiking, wrestling, running, soccer etc. Keep your peak performance and have peace of mind knowing your ankle will not be at risk of injury. Unlike an ankle sleeve, our brace can be adjusted in order to customize the level of support you are after. The lace-up front and straps give you the freedom to adjust tightness. ✅ Accurate fit: Having the right size ankle brace is important to make sure the device functions properly, keeps your ankle secure and does not move excessively.

<p>Will ankle braces cause my ankles to weaken? There is no evidence that suggests that ankle bracing weakens the ankle. Our ankle braces are not engineered to be so restrictive that the ankle cannot function on it&rsquo;s own. The brace is only there for a support.</p>

<p>Most have shown that braces are slightly more effective than taping but that both are better than no support at all. One study found that simply wearing high-top sneakers instead of low-tops prevented some ankle injuries and that high-tops plus taping had more than 50% fewer injuries than low-tops plus taping.</p>

<p>Myth #3: Wearing ankle braces promotes ankle weakness “There is a misconception that if you wear a brace you don&rsquo;t need to use the ankle as much, so people come to the conclusion without evidence that they will lose the strength; however, no studies have proven this.”</p>

<p>If an ankle sprain does not heal correctly, the joint may become unstable, resulting in a weakened and easily reinjured ankle. Proper initial care of your sprained ankle is critical.

<p>Hinged-cuff ankle braces are the best ankle brace for individuals and athletes to wear for mild/moderate ankle instability, chronic ankle instability, or for acute ankle injury bracing. No other type of brace gets as close to the ankle while allowing it to retain its strength and full range of motion during activity.Apr 13, 2017</p>
