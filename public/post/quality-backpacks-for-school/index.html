Good christmas gift for you and your friend\rFree shipping\rDetails\rAre backpacks good for your back? A backpack that isn’t used properly can cause back problems or even injury. Here’s how: By putting a heavy weight on your shoulders in the wrong way, the weight’s force can pull you backward. So people who carry heavy backpacks sometimes lean forward.\nWhich bag is best for posture? So shoulder bags are the worst for your posture, followed by a cross body bag. “Anything with uneven weight distribution will essentially lead to more muscle imbalances as your body compensates for the weight distribution,” says Dr. Leary. That’s why backpacks or a rolling bag are best.Sep 11, 2019\nHow do you wear a backpack so it doesn’t hurt your back? To avoid injury, always wear shoulder straps when carrying the bag and tighten the belts to bring the weight closer to your back. Ensure that the heaviest items are low and towards the center of the bag, so it is not putting extra strain on your shoulders. The way you lift your bag is imperative!Oct 19, 2020\n",

<h2 id="are-backpacks-good-for-your-back">Are backpacks good for your back?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#are-backpacks-good-for-your-back">#</a></h2>
<p>A backpack that isn&rsquo;t used properly can cause back problems or even injury. Here&rsquo;s how: By putting a heavy weight on your shoulders in the wrong way, the weight&rsquo;s force can pull you backward. So people who carry heavy backpacks sometimes lean forward.</p>
<h2 id="which-bag-is-best-for-posture">Which bag is best for posture?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#which-bag-is-best-for-posture">#</a></h2>
<p>So shoulder bags are the worst for your posture, followed by a cross body bag. &ldquo;Anything with uneven weight distribution will essentially lead to more muscle imbalances as your body compensates for the weight distribution,&rdquo; says Dr. Leary. That&rsquo;s why backpacks or a rolling bag are best.Sep 11, 2019</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-wear-a-backpack-so-it-doesnt-hurt-your-back">How do you wear a backpack so it doesn&rsquo;t hurt your back?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-you-wear-a-backpack-so-it-doesnt-hurt-your-back">#</a></h2>
<p>To avoid injury, always wear shoulder straps when carrying the bag and tighten the belts to bring the weight closer to your back. Ensure that the heaviest items are low and towards the center of the bag, so it is not putting extra strain on your shoulders. The way you lift your bag is imperative!Oct 19, 2020</p>
