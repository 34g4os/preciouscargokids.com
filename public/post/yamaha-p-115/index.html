The Yamaha P115 digital piano is a step up from the P45, offering improved sound quality and cool additional features that will be appreciated by more experienced players.Mar 24, 2015\nIs the P-115 a good piano? It would be a great instrument not only for beginners but also for intermediate or even advanced players, considering the P-115’s hammer-action keyboard, 192-note polyphony and wonderful piano sound sampled from the Yamaha CFIIIS 9’ concert grand. The P115 is also great for learning on.Apr 10, 2020\nDoes the Yamaha P45 sound good? The sound you’ll hear on the P45 is a true stereo sound recorded from a full concert grand piano at different dynamic levels. The P45 is not great for musicians who need a variety of instrument sounds and sound effects to create music. The piano has only a basic set of sounds, which would satisfy most piano players.Apr 10, 2020\nIs the Yamaha P115 discontinued? Although the piano has been discontinued by Yamaha and has been replaced by the newer P-125, a lot of people still refers to it whenever they see a member of the P-Line.Oct 30, 2019\nIs the Yamaha P-125 good for beginners? The Yamaha P125 is designed for beginners to explore the instrument and start their learning journey of piano. It is also a good choice as a secondary practicing instrument for any pianist. As for gigging musicians, if you have the budget, there are better options on the market.Oct 13, 2019\nIs Yamaha P-125 good for classical music? P125 has light and fast action but there is almost no escapement and dynamic control touch is worst each all of three keyboards. Sound preferences are very subjective but for classical performances I would advice to buy Pianoteq Stage in the future as a next improving accessory for your piano.Nov 1, 2019\nIs Yamaha P-125 worth it Reddit? While it’s the budget digital piano action of the Yamaha line, it’s definitely not a bad action at all – the Yamaha P-125 is still one of the most recommended entry level digital pianos because it’s a solid instrument all around.Aug 18, 2021\nHow old is the Yamaha P-125? The Yamaha P-125 is a portable digital piano introduced in 2018. It replaces its predecessor, the P-115.\nIs Yamaha P115 better than p45? Voices and Songs series does a good job, nevertheless the P115 is still able to outperform the Yamaha p45 with a total number of 14 voices and 50 songs.\nIs the Yamaha P115 discontinued? Although the piano has been discontinued by Yamaha and has been replaced by the newer P-125, a lot of people still refers to it whenever they see a member of the P-Line.Oct 30, 2019\nWhen did the Yamaha P115 come out? 2015\nIs the P-45 a good piano? Overall the sounds contained within the P-45 are great - the grand piano in particular. Although 10 voices is a lot less than some other beginner pianos on the market, each sound here is very usable. Yamaha has cleverly included sounds players actually want, meaning there are no unwanted voices you simply won’t use.Aug 17, 2021\nIs Yamaha P45 good for advanced players? Unfortunately, I can not recommend the Yamaha P45 for players above the intermediate level. Two crucial reasons are the limited polyphony and the duo sensor used in the key action.Mar 9, 2020\nIs Yamaha P45 good for intermediate? Whether you are a beginner, or an intermediate player, the Yamaha P (Portable) 45 digital piano is popular for its simplified level of control, high quality, and low cost.\nIs the Yamaha P45 heavy? Weight. This piano is ever so slightly heavier than equivalent pianos from other manufacturers. However, not by much; the Casio PX160 weighs 11.3kg whereas the Yamaha P45 weighs 11.5kg.Sep 11, 2021\nIs the Yamaha P-125 discontinued? The Yamaha P115 is not produced anymore. The production of the renowned P115 was discontinued in 2018. This is because the P125 was released to replace the P115. Although considered an upgrade, the P125 has a lot of features similar to the P115 it replaced.\nWhen did Yamaha P115 come out? 2015\nIs Yamaha P115 better than P45? Voices and Songs series does a good job, nevertheless the P115 is still able to outperform the Yamaha p45 with a total number of 14 voices and 50 songs.\nIs Yamaha coming out with a new keyboard? Yamaha introduces two new keyboards to their 2021 product line: the YC73 and YC88 Stage Keyboards. Both models are gig-ready and take inspiration from the manufacturer’s YC61 model introduced last year, offering great feel and action, soulful sounds and drawbar control.Jan 18, 2021\nIs Yamaha P45 and p45b the same? There is actually No Difference Between the Yamaha P-45 and the P-45b, the B at the of the model’s name stands to indicate the black color. But wait …. there is another plot twist… all p-45 models are made in black, meaning you will not find a single Yamaha p45 that is made in white or any other color.\nIs Korg B2 better than Yamaha P45? The B2 also has a higher maximum polyphony (which is the number of samples able to be played at the same time), at 120 compared to the P45 having only 64. The only drawback of the B2 in regards to its sound is that there is slightly less clarity compared to the P45.\nIs Yamaha P115 better than P-45? Voices and Songs series does a good job, nevertheless the P115 is still able to outperform the Yamaha p45 with a total number of 14 voices and 50 songs.\nWhen did the Yamaha P45 release? 2015\n",

<h2 id="what-replaced-the-yamaha-p45">What replaced the Yamaha P45?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-replaced-the-yamaha-p45">#</a></h2>
<p>The Yamaha P115 digital piano is a step up from the P45, offering improved sound quality and cool additional features that will be appreciated by more experienced players.Mar 24, 2015</p>
<h2 id="is-the-p-115-a-good-piano">Is the P-115 a good piano?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-the-p-115-a-good-piano">#</a></h2>
<p>It would be a great instrument not only for beginners but also for intermediate or even advanced players, considering the P-115&rsquo;s hammer-action keyboard, 192-note polyphony and wonderful piano sound sampled from the Yamaha CFIIIS 9&rsquo; concert grand. The P115 is also great for learning on.Apr 10, 2020</p>
<h2 id="does-the-yamaha-p45-sound-good">Does the Yamaha P45 sound good?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-the-yamaha-p45-sound-good">#</a></h2>
<p>The sound you&rsquo;ll hear on the P45 is a true stereo sound recorded from a full concert grand piano at different dynamic levels. The P45 is not great for musicians who need a variety of instrument sounds and sound effects to create music. The piano has only a basic set of sounds, which would satisfy most piano players.Apr 10, 2020</p>

<p>The Yamaha P125 is designed for beginners to explore the instrument and start their learning journey of piano. It is also a good choice as a secondary practicing instrument for any pianist. As for gigging musicians, if you have the budget, there are better options on the market.Oct 13, 2019</p>

<p>P125 has light and fast action but there is almost no escapement and dynamic control touch is worst each all of three keyboards. Sound preferences are very subjective but for classical performances I would advice to buy Pianoteq Stage in the future as a next improving accessory for your piano.Nov 1, 2019</p>

<p>While it&rsquo;s the budget digital piano action of the Yamaha line, it&rsquo;s definitely not a bad action at all &ndash; the Yamaha P-125 is still one of the most recommended entry level digital pianos because it&rsquo;s a solid instrument all around.Aug 18, 2021</p>

<p>Overall the sounds contained within the P-45 are great - the grand piano in particular. Although 10 voices is a lot less than some other beginner pianos on the market, each sound here is very usable. Yamaha has cleverly included sounds players actually want, meaning there are no unwanted voices you simply won&rsquo;t use.Aug 17, 2021</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can not recommend the Yamaha P45 for players above the intermediate level. Two crucial reasons are the limited polyphony and the duo sensor used in the key action.Mar 9, 2020</p>

<p>Weight. This piano is ever so slightly heavier than equivalent pianos from other manufacturers. However, not by much; the Casio PX160 weighs 11.3kg whereas the Yamaha P45 weighs 11.5kg.Sep 11, 2021</p>

<p>Yamaha introduces two new keyboards to their 2021 product line: the YC73 and YC88 Stage Keyboards. Both models are gig-ready and take inspiration from the manufacturer&rsquo;s YC61 model introduced last year, offering great feel and action, soulful sounds and drawbar control.Jan 18, 2021</p>

<p>There is actually No Difference Between the Yamaha P-45 and the P-45b, the B at the of the model&rsquo;s name stands to indicate the black color. But wait …. there is another plot twist… all p-45 models are made in black, meaning you will not find a single Yamaha p45 that is made in white or any other color.</p>
