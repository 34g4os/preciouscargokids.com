                Experiencing discomfort in your joints? Take back joint comfort with Turmeric &amp; Ginger. Both Turmeric and Ginger balance inflammation in the joints, helping to relieve occasional discomfort and return your get-up-and-go.* If digestive support is what you’re after, this is the supplement for you too. Ginger is perhaps the best known ingredient for calming and nurturing the stomach, while Turmeric helps to balance inflammation, aiding your body’s digestive process.* To help get the most from the Turmeric in this supplement, we’ve added BioPerine, a trademarked Black Pepper extract. This contains at least 95% Piperine, which has been clinically proven to maximize how much curcumin your body absorbs.* We only use quality ingredients. This supplement contains both Organic Turmeric and a 4:1 standardized Turmeric Extract, so you can rest assured that you’re getting all the Turmeric your body needs to support your joints and digestive system.* Turmeric Ginger is made in the USA in a GMP-certified facility. We know that you care about your health, so we make sure that each serving is non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, nut-free and soy-free.
