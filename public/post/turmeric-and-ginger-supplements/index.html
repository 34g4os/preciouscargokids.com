                Experiencing discomfort in your joints? Take back joint comfort with Turmeric &amp; Ginger. Both Turmeric and Ginger balance inflammation in the joints, helping to relieve occasional discomfort and return your get-up-and-go.* If digestive support is what youâ€™re after, this is the supplement for you too. Ginger is perhaps the best known ingredient for calming and nurturing the stomach, while Turmeric helps to balance inflammation, aiding your bodyâ€™s digestive process.* To help get the most from the Turmeric in this supplement, weâ€™ve added BioPerine, a trademarked Black Pepper extract. This contains at least 95% Piperine, which has been clinically proven to maximize how much curcumin your body absorbs.* We only use quality ingredients. This supplement contains both Organic Turmeric and a 4:1 standardized Turmeric Extract, so you can rest assured that youâ€™re getting all the Turmeric your body needs to support your joints and digestive system.* Turmeric Ginger is made in the USA in a GMP-certified facility. We know that you care about your health, so we make sure that each serving is non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, nut-free and soy-free.
