This means you can move up and down the temperatures you need with ease. In fact, boiling a pan of water on an induction cook top is far quicker than either gas or electric so this helps you save energy as well. It also helps you cook with more accuracy.\nDo portable stoves use a lot of electricity? The amount of power consumed from the electric utility company to operate these burners over a 30-day period ‚Äî if a single burner is used for one hour per day ‚Äî is 36 kilowatt-hours for the small burner, between 45 and 54 kWh for a medium-sized burner, and 75 or more kWh for the large burner.\n",

<p>Most electric ovens draw between 2,000 and 5,000 watts, with the average electric stove wattage coming in at around 3,000 watts. So how much energy does an electric stove use per hour? Assuming an electricity rate of 12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), a 3000-watt oven will cost you about 36 cents per hour at high heat.</p>
