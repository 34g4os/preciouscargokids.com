Given that she studied Luke’s ancient Jedi texts and was trained by Leia, Rey most likely used a variation of Form VI, Niman. Form VI, Niman, takes elements from the previous five forms and combines them into a pastiche that’s proficient in all situations, but lacks the specialization of other forms.Sep 18, 2021\nWhy is Kylo Ren’s lightsaber shaped like a cross? In The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary, it’s confirmed that Kylo Ren’s lightsaber contains a “cracked kyber crystal that is the cause of [the] ragged, unstable appearance” of the central blade and the two smaller blades that comprise the crossguard.May 9, 2019\nDoes Kylo Ren have a lightsaber form? Kylo Ren’s Lightsaber Form Ren’s fierce fighting style has the hallmarks of Djem So, which demands a high degree of speed and strength to execute a flurry of attacks and counterattacks. His ability to deflect blaster fire in deft fashion is another characteristic of the Form V master.\nWhat form does Ren use? We can see that Ren uses a hybrid of Form V, which utilized both Djem-So and Shien, Form VII, Juyo, and Form VI, Niman. This allowed for him to be unpredictable in combat, which suited both his personality and his fighting style.Jul 14, 2021\nIs Kylo Ren’s lightsaber special? The lightsaber was further modified with the addition of quillon emitters, changing its original standard-hilt design into a crossguard lightsaber. Emulating an ancient design, Kylo Ren’s lightsaber housed an unstable kyber crystal.\nWhy is Kylo Ren’s lightsaber so different? In The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary, it’s confirmed that Kylo Ren’s lightsaber contains a “cracked kyber crystal that is the cause of [the] ragged, unstable appearance” of the central blade and the two smaller blades that comprise the crossguard.\nIs Kylo Ren’s lightsaber practical? In truth, Kylo Ren appears to have adopted this lightsaber blade for a practical reason rather than simply for aesthetic effect; he bungled the process by which he turned his kyber crystal red, known as “bleeding,” and it cracked as a result.Apr 14, 2021\nWhy is Kylo Ren’s kyber crystal cracked? In this process, the crystal resists. It is possible, that Kylo Ren cracked it by accident, because he was not patient and exerted too much dark side Force on the crystal.Jan 20, 2021\nIs Kylo Ren’s lightsaber unique? The Story of Kylo Ren’s Lightsaber Hilt Ren’s crossguard lightsaber is far from unique. Sporting two secondary blades (quillons) protruding from the top of the hilt at 90-degree angles, it is actually based on a design that was created thousands of years before his birth.\nWhy is Kylo Ren’s lightsaber crackly? In The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary, it’s confirmed that Kylo Ren’s lightsaber contains a “cracked kyber crystal that is the cause of [the] ragged, unstable appearance” of the central blade and the two smaller blades that comprise the crossguard.\nWhy does Kylo Ren’s lightsaber have a crossguard? The crossguard blades allow Ren’s saber to operate safely – his weapon is constructed around a dangerously flawed kyber crystal, which would be overloaded if not for the lateral plasma vents that create the quillons.\nIs Kylo Ren’s lightsaber practical? In truth, Kylo Ren appears to have adopted this lightsaber blade for a practical reason rather than simply for aesthetic effect; he bungled the process by which he turned his kyber crystal red, known as “bleeding,” and it cracked as a result.Apr 14, 2021\n",

<p>Given that she studied Luke&rsquo;s ancient Jedi texts and was trained by Leia, Rey most likely used a variation of Form VI, Niman. Form VI, Niman, takes elements from the previous five forms and combines them into a pastiche that&rsquo;s proficient in all situations, but lacks the specialization of other forms.Sep 18, 2021</p>

<p>In The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary, it&rsquo;s confirmed that Kylo Ren&rsquo;s lightsaber contains a “cracked kyber crystal that is the cause of [the] ragged, unstable appearance” of the central blade and the two smaller blades that comprise the crossguard.May 9, 2019</p>
<h2 id="does-kylo-ren-have-a-lightsaber-form">Does Kylo Ren have a lightsaber form?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-kylo-ren-have-a-lightsaber-form">#</a></h2>
<p>Kylo Ren&rsquo;s Lightsaber Form Ren&rsquo;s fierce fighting style has the hallmarks of Djem So, which demands a high degree of speed and strength to execute a flurry of attacks and counterattacks. His ability to deflect blaster fire in deft fashion is another characteristic of the Form V master.</p>
<h2 id="what-form-does-ren-use">What form does Ren use?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-form-does-ren-use">#</a></h2>
<p>We can see that Ren uses a hybrid of Form V, which utilized both Djem-So and Shien, Form VII, Juyo, and Form VI, Niman. This allowed for him to be unpredictable in combat, which suited both his personality and his fighting style.Jul 14, 2021</p>

<p>The lightsaber was further modified with the addition of quillon emitters, changing its original standard-hilt design into a crossguard lightsaber. Emulating an ancient design, Kylo Ren&rsquo;s lightsaber housed an unstable kyber crystal.</p>

<p>In truth, Kylo Ren appears to have adopted this lightsaber blade for a practical reason rather than simply for aesthetic effect; he bungled the process by which he turned his kyber crystal red, known as &ldquo;bleeding,&rdquo; and it cracked as a result.Apr 14, 2021</p>

<p>In this process, the crystal resists. It is possible, that Kylo Ren cracked it by accident, because he was not patient and exerted too much dark side Force on the crystal.Jan 20, 2021</p>
<h2 id="is-kylo-rens-lightsaber-unique">Is Kylo Ren&rsquo;s lightsaber unique?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-kylo-rens-lightsaber-unique">#</a></h2>
<p>The Story of Kylo Ren&rsquo;s Lightsaber Hilt Ren&rsquo;s crossguard lightsaber is far from unique. Sporting two secondary blades (quillons) protruding from the top of the hilt at 90-degree angles, it is actually based on a design that was created thousands of years before his birth.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-kylo-rens-lightsaber-crackly">Why is Kylo Ren&rsquo;s lightsaber crackly?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-is-kylo-rens-lightsaber-crackly">#</a></h2>

<p>The crossguard blades allow Ren&rsquo;s saber to operate safely – his weapon is constructed around a dangerously flawed kyber crystal, which would be overloaded if not for the lateral plasma vents that create the quillons.</p>
