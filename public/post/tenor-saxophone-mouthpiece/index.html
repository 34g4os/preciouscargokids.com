Can alto sax reeds be used with tenor and other saxophones? Alto sax reeds could theoretically work with the closest sax types, such as tenor. Nonetheless, they are not as efficient in delivering sound as matching reeds because reeds are optimized to work with specific sizes of saxophones and sax mouthpieces.\nDoes ligature matter sax? This ligature provides an excellent grip with very little tightening required. You can tighten this screw with just a very small amount of pressure and it still holds the reed on there well without ever slipping. It also fits a much wider range of mouthpieces.Jun 23, 2019\nAre tenor and alto sax mouthpiece the same? This value V* depends on the volume of the saxophone body, so it’s about the same for all mouthpieces of a given saxophone kind (alto, tenor…). But of course, different models have different geometries.\nDoes mouthpiece affect saxophone? The saxophone is a wind instrument, so from an acoustic point of view, the material of the different components (including the mouthpiece) has no effect on the sound. In fact, it’s the internal geometry of the bore which is most important.\nWhat is the difference in saxophone mouthpieces? For sax mouthpieces the common rule is that softer materials produce a darker sound with less projection, while harder materials just the opposite (brighter and more projection). From plastics to metal though, you have a wide range of options to choose from, allowing you to truly customize your sound.Oct 24, 2018\nDo mouthpieces make a difference? Being your first point of contact with the mouthpiece, your mouthpiece has more influence on the quality of your sound than any other piece of equipment. In order to set yourself up for the most success, a quality mouthpiece is simply a must-have.Apr 20, 2017\nDo alto and tenor sax play the same notes? Beyond the aesthetics, the size of the two instruments makes a difference in the notes that they produce. Since the alto sax is smaller, its notes are higher and brighter than those of the tenor sax. The tenor sax produces a mellow, rich, and deep sound.May 13, 2016\nIs tenor sax easier than alto? You’ll find the smaller the instrument the better your breath control needs to be. Therefore, the tenor is easier to blow than the alto. It also has a more relaxed embouchure than the alto. However, you will struggle in the beginning to play it as quietly as the alto.Dec 16, 2017\nHow do you transpose from tenor sax to alto? Therefore, up a perfect fifth is the same note name as down a perfect fourth. And down a perfect fifth is the same note name as up a perfect fourth. So to go from Bb tenor saxophone to Eb alto saxophone notes, you go up a perfect fifth (or down a perfect fourth). C on tenor sax up a fifth makes it a G on alto sax.\nAre alto and tenor sax mouthpieces interchangeable? Mouthpieces are interchangeable, so most of them will fit any neck. Even if the mouthpiece is a little too loose or too tight, the cork can be easily shaved or replaced, so you can choose any mouthpiece you like.\nCan you use an alto ligature on tenor? If the ligature fits, you can use it. There is no difference between alto and tenor ligatures, except for side.Mar 6, 2016\nDo all saxophones use the same mouthpiece? Saxophone mouthpieces come in a variety of different sizes and are made of different materials. The size of each mouthpiece refers to the tip opening. Like reeds, different mouthpiece brands have different ways of referring to the size of the tip opening, usually either numerical or alphabetical.Mar 30, 2017\nCan tenor sax play alto sax music? If you’re playing alone, you can do pretty much whatever you want. If you are playing a solo along with an accompaniment then you will be playing in the wrong key if you don’t do the transposition.Jun 28, 2004\nCan you use an alto sax mouthpiece on a tenor sax? Alto sax reeds could theoretically work with the closest sax types, such as tenor. Nonetheless, they are not as efficient in delivering sound as matching reeds because reeds are optimized to work with specific sizes of saxophones and sax mouthpieces.\nDo alto and tenor sax have the same mouthpiece? This value V* depends on the volume of the saxophone body, so it’s about the same for all mouthpieces of a given saxophone kind (alto, tenor…). But of course, different models have different geometries.\nCan you use an alto ligature on tenor? If the ligature fits, you can use it. There is no difference between alto and tenor ligatures, except for side.Mar 6, 2016\nAre tenor and alto sax the same? Size. The most obvious difference between the two instruments is their size. The tenor sax is slightly larger and heavier, while the alto sax is smaller, lighter, and more easily managed than a tenor. The neck of an alto saxophone also comes up slightly at the end, while the neck of a tenor bends slightly down.May 13, 2016\nIs Yamaha 5C a good mouthpiece? Definitely, worth the upgrade! Initially, it took a little time to adjust but worth the perseverance because the tone and the sound is unbelievably better quality in comparison to the standard mouthpiece you receive with your sax.\nIs Yamaha 4C a jazz mouthpiece? From “loud” styles such as Rock, Pop or Jazz, to “soft” styles such as Classical, Folk, or Relaxation music, the Yamaha 4C Alto Saxophone mouthpiece has got you covered.Sep 24, 2018\nWhat is the difference between saxophone mouthpiece sizes? The Saxophone Mouthpiece (and Clarinet Mouthpiece) Tip Size, or Tip-Opening, is the distance between the reed and mouthpiece tip. This number is usually on the side of the mouthpiece body, or on the table. The smaller the tip size the more narrow the opening; the larger the tip size the larger the opening.\nWhat do saxophone mouthpiece numbers mean? The number on a saxophone mouthpiece represents the size of the tip opening, usually on a scale of 1 – 10. Lower numbers indicate smaller tip openings, while higher numbers indicate larger tip openings. Unfortunately, mouthpieces are rarely labelled consistently between brands.\nDo all mouthpieces fit all saxophones? Mouthpieces are interchangeable, so most of them will fit any neck. Even if the mouthpiece is a little too loose or too tight, the cork can be easily shaved or replaced, so you can choose any mouthpiece you like.\nWhat type of mouthpiece does the saxophone use? Clarinet and saxophone mouthpieces have been made out of hard (vulcanized) rubber, brass or other metal, crystal, glass, plastic, and wood. Today, the most common material for professional clarinet and (classical) saxophone mouthpieces is hard rubber.\nHow do you know what size mouthpiece for a saxophone? The Saxophone Mouthpiece (and Clarinet Mouthpiece) Tip Size, or Tip-Opening, is the distance between the reed and mouthpiece tip. This number is usually on the side of the mouthpiece body, or on the table. The smaller the tip size the more narrow the opening; the larger the tip size the larger the opening.\n",

<p>Can alto sax reeds be used with tenor and other saxophones? Alto sax reeds could theoretically work with the closest sax types, such as tenor. Nonetheless, they are not as efficient in delivering sound as matching reeds because reeds are optimized to work with specific sizes of saxophones and sax mouthpieces.</p>
<h2 id="does-ligature-matter-sax">Does ligature matter sax?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-ligature-matter-sax">#</a></h2>
<p>This ligature provides an excellent grip with very little tightening required. You can tighten this screw with just a very small amount of pressure and it still holds the reed on there well without ever slipping. It also fits a much wider range of mouthpieces.Jun 23, 2019</p>

<p>This value V* depends on the volume of the saxophone body, so it&rsquo;s about the same for all mouthpieces of a given saxophone kind (alto, tenor&hellip;). But of course, different models have different geometries.</p>
<h2 id="does-mouthpiece-affect-saxophone">Does mouthpiece affect saxophone?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-mouthpiece-affect-saxophone">#</a></h2>
<p>The saxophone is a wind instrument, so from an acoustic point of view, the material of the different components (including the mouthpiece) has no effect on the sound. In fact, it&rsquo;s the internal geometry of the bore which is most important.</p>

<p>For sax mouthpieces the common rule is that softer materials produce a darker sound with less projection, while harder materials just the opposite (brighter and more projection). From plastics to metal though, you have a wide range of options to choose from, allowing you to truly customize your sound.Oct 24, 2018</p>
<h2 id="do-mouthpieces-make-a-difference">Do mouthpieces make a difference?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#do-mouthpieces-make-a-difference">#</a></h2>
<p>Being your first point of contact with the mouthpiece, your mouthpiece has more influence on the quality of your sound than any other piece of equipment. In order to set yourself up for the most success, a quality mouthpiece is simply a must-have.Apr 20, 2017</p>

<p>Beyond the aesthetics, the size of the two instruments makes a difference in the notes that they produce. Since the alto sax is smaller, its notes are higher and brighter than those of the tenor sax. The tenor sax produces a mellow, rich, and deep sound.May 13, 2016</p>
<h2 id="is-tenor-sax-easier-than-alto">Is tenor sax easier than alto?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-tenor-sax-easier-than-alto">#</a></h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find the smaller the instrument the better your breath control needs to be. Therefore, the tenor is easier to blow than the alto. It also has a more relaxed embouchure than the alto. However, you will struggle in the beginning to play it as quietly as the alto.Dec 16, 2017</p>

<p>Therefore, up a perfect fifth is the same note name as down a perfect fourth. And down a perfect fifth is the same note name as up a perfect fourth. So to go from Bb tenor saxophone to Eb alto saxophone notes, you go up a perfect fifth (or down a perfect fourth). C on tenor sax up a fifth makes it a G on alto sax.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re playing alone, you can do pretty much whatever you want. If you are playing a solo along with an accompaniment then you will be playing in the wrong key if you don&rsquo;t do the transposition.Jun 28, 2004</p>

<p>Size. The most obvious difference between the two instruments is their size. The tenor sax is slightly larger and heavier, while the alto sax is smaller, lighter, and more easily managed than a tenor. The neck of an alto saxophone also comes up slightly at the end, while the neck of a tenor bends slightly down.May 13, 2016</p>

<p>The Saxophone Mouthpiece (and Clarinet Mouthpiece) Tip Size, or Tip-Opening, is the distance between the reed and mouthpiece tip. This number is usually on the side of the mouthpiece body, or on the table. The smaller the tip size the more narrow the opening; the larger the tip size the larger the opening.</p>

<p>The number on a saxophone mouthpiece represents the size of the tip opening, usually on a scale of 1 – 10. Lower numbers indicate smaller tip openings, while higher numbers indicate larger tip openings. Unfortunately, mouthpieces are rarely labelled consistently between brands.</p>

<p>The Saxophone Mouthpiece (and Clarinet Mouthpiece) Tip Size, or Tip-Opening, is the distance between the reed and mouthpiece tip. This number is usually on the side of the mouthpiece body, or on the table. The smaller the tip size the more narrow the opening; the larger the tip size the larger the opening.</p>
