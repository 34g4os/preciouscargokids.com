For safety purposes only, LED lights are recommended for babies. This is because when they start to take their first steps, it becomes essential for them not trip on cables or floor lamps. It never hurts to remember that there are devices to cover plugs and prevent electrical shocks.May 27, 2019\nDo light up toys count as screen time? While toys that light up decidedly do not fall under the category of screen time, you may notice that many parents who restrict screen time also restrict their child’s use of them.\nWhat kind of toys should babies not be given? Avoid marbles, coins, balls, and games with balls that are 1.75 inches (4.4 centimeters) in diameter or less because they can become lodged in the throat above the windpipe and cause trouble with breathing. Battery-operated toys should have battery cases that secure with screws so that kids cannot pry them open.\n",
