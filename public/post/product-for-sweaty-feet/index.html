                ULTRA ABSORBENT: Summer Soles adhesive liners bring freshness to any sandal - even mules, flats, and pumps. Our full size insoles have a peel-and-stick backing that stays firmly in place, yet leaves no residue on your shoes! STOP SWEATY FEET: Summer Soles make open shoes and sandals instantly comfy! For hyperhidrosis sufferers, these liners help stop sweaty feet from severely limiting your summer footwear options by absorbing moisture to promote a healthy foot environment. UNIQUE FIBER BLEND: Summer Soles use a non-woven fabric that absorbs moisture and channels it away from your feet where it dissipates quickly. Wool-rayon blend is the perfect combination for absorption and evaporation while preventing unpleasant odors. NATURAL WOOL DESIGN: Wool has been used for years in the medical industry because fibers naturally grab each other, leaving spaces that let air and moisture pass to keep cool in the summer. So feet feel dry- even when wearing pantyhose. FOR VARIETY OF SHOE STYLES: Perfect for sandals, pumps, mules, flats - but just the dressy kind, with leather or shiny synthetic soles. Not for spongy flip flops or fabric-bottomed styles. Usually minor trimming is necessary to fit to your shoe.
