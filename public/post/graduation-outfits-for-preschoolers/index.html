<p>Color is an essential element when choosing an outfit. Graduation may not be a formal event, but you need to be modest. Avoid colors that are too bright or too dull. Colors like white, blue, grey, peach, black, and silver are among the best.Jul 2, 2021</p>

<p>Being Underdressed or Overdressed Clothes that are too formal, or not formal enough, will make you feel out of place when you should feel relaxed. Wearing jeans to your college graduation probably isn&rsquo;t a smart choice, but a ball gown isn&rsquo;t quite right, either. Aim for business or business casual for the ceremony.May 29, 2020</p>

<p>Graduations tend to happen in the summer months, and the ceremonies can last a while, so it&rsquo;s important to wear fabrics that are breathable and comfortable (like linen or cotton). And the style, as we&rsquo;ve mentioned, should be semi-formal or business casual.Mar 11, 2022</p>
