It’s more suitable for commercial recessed lighting, commercial downlighting and up lighting and for exterior security and flood lighting.\nHow many lumens should outdoor lights be? The best range of lumens for outdoor lighting is 12 to 1,300 lumens. How many lumens you need for outdoor landscape lighting is between 50 and 700. The amount of brightness most people want changes based on location.\nIs 3000 lumens too bright? 3000 lumens is a good level of light for LED, CFL or incandescent lighting. It’s suitable for recessed lighting, downlighting, up lighting and within pendants.\nHow bright is 3500 lumens? Flashlight Enthusiast Yes, 3,500 lumens lights up way more than 2,000. As has been said, the beam profile makes a big difference, as does tint and colour temp.Nov 8, 2011\nHow bright is 1600 lumens? The brightness, or lumen levels, of the lights in your home may vary widely, so here’s a rule of thumb: To replace a 100 watt (W) incandescent bulb, look for a bulb that gives you about 1600 lumens. If you want something dimmer, go for fewer lumens; if you prefer brighter light, look for more lumens.\nDo you need a special bulb for a dusk to dawn light? Well, I have great news: You can easily convert any standard light fixture into a dusk-to-dawn light yourself by simply replacing the bulb. Yes, you read that right. Just replace the bulb!Oct 5, 2019\nCan you use LED bulbs in outdoor fixtures? The good news is that LED lights, in general, are quite durable. As long as your LED lights are housed properly and have the right sealing, it is safe to use them in an outdoor context. One important thing to know, though, is that LEDs come with different ratings, which is known as Ingress Protection, or IP rating.\nAre LED bulbs compatible with photocells? But to reiterate: yes, LED lights will flicker if paired with incompatible photocells. This is because the low current of the photocell will interfere with the LED.Jul 6, 2020\nDo outdoor motion lights need special bulbs? Do Motion Sensor Lights Need Special Bulbs? No, motion sensor lights do not require special bulbs. A motion detector basically consists of a motion sensor for motion detection and an electrical switch. In general, it does not matter whether the motion detector switches an incandescent bulb or LED light.\nHow strong is 3000 lumens? 30-40 foot candles are around 3,000-4,000 lumens. In other words, 3,000 lumens is meant to give a room a brighter light. This is not ideal if you have a small room and it’s a bedroom. You don’t want to blind your eyes when you’re about to go to bed.Nov 19, 2021\nHow much area will 3000 lumens light up? To determine the needed lumens, you will need to multiply your room square footage by your room foot-candle requirement. For example, a 100 square foot living room, which needs 10-20 foot-candles, will need 1,000-2,000 lumens. A 100 square foot dining room, which needs 30-40 foot-candles, will need 3,000-4,000 lumens.Jul 2, 2018\nHow many lumens is considered bright? 100 lumens is considered bright enough for most walkways — including commercial properties. 100 lumens is equivalent to about 20 watts.\nHow long do dusk to dawn sensors last? Most of these lights allow you to choose how long you want the light to stay on (usually between 5 seconds and 10 minutes) once the movement has been detected. Most dawn to dusk lights are activated throughout the night, but the motion-activated lights don’t remain on that long (depending on your settings).Aug 7, 2020\nDo dusk to dawn light bulbs burn out? Dusk to dawn lights have an estimated lifespan of 30,000 to 50,000 hours if taken care of properly.\nHow long will outdoor LED lights last? Outdoor LED lights can last up to 50,000 hours with the right maintenance and care. If you’d like to improve your home’s ambiance and safety, you can’t go wrong with eco-friendly and long-lasting LED lighting.Nov 9, 2020\nHow long do LED Night Lights last? Typically, LED bulbs can last between 35,000 and 50,000 hours. This is over 17x more than the lifespan of an incandescent bulb! Furthermore, since LEDs do not contain a filament, they do not burn out in the same way as incandescent bulbs.Apr 9, 2020\n",

<p>The good news is that LED lights, in general, are quite durable. As long as your LED lights are housed properly and have the right sealing, it is safe to use them in an outdoor context. One important thing to know, though, is that LEDs come with different ratings, which is known as Ingress Protection, or IP rating.</p>

<p>To determine the needed lumens, you will need to multiply your room square footage by your room foot-candle requirement. For example, a 100 square foot living room, which needs 10-20 foot-candles, will need 1,000-2,000 lumens. A 100 square foot dining room, which needs 30-40 foot-candles, will need 3,000-4,000 lumens.Jul 2, 2018</p>
