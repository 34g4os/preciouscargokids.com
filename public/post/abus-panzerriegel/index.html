                Premium Quality: Our security chains are made of hardened steel with a special anti-corrosion coating which makes them ideal for outdoor use. Each link has a thickness of 5/16 , inside height of 1 3/8  and inside width of 1/2 .This chain requires 6 tons of cutting force to break through the hardened steel. Theft Deterrence: Our chain cannot be compromised by typical aggressive burglary attacks. Each individual link is unique in that the shape is squared rather than round. The squared link construction makes it almost impossible for theft tools to get a secure grip on the chain to cut. The thick hardened steel is extra resistant to sawing and the welded finish makes prying insurmountable. Secure Anything: ABUS square link security chains are utilized by both industrial and consumer users. Our customers trust this chain to secure their commercial/residential properties, containers, bikes, gates, fences, trailers, ATV’s, motorcycles and much more. Scratch Resistant: Traditional security chains expose your items/property to potential damages and scratches when in use. ABUS security chains feature a nylon sleeve to protect your property from scratches and damages while in use. Synonymous with Security: ABUS has been manufacturing and innovating security technology since 1924. When it comes to protecting lives and valuables, ABUS provides security solutions to help you feel safe and secure.
