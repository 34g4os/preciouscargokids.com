                Family Heritage: A beautiful representation of how families are connected through many generations. Created with sterling silver, cubic zirconia stone-encrusted leaves and genuine 14k gold details, Pandora s lovely family tree dangle charm is the perfect token of family love. Sterling Silver: The world’s most popular silver alloy, our sterling silver consists of 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals (such as copper). This blend is excellent for jewelry because it preserves the color, luster and the weight of silver while vastly improving the durability of your charms. 14 Karat Gold: 14K gold is a mix of gold and other metals that makes the jewelry durable while maintaining a beautiful, golden glow. Cubic Zirconia: Cherised for its sparkling appearance and its availability in virtually all colors, cubic zirconia s beauty has made it one of the most popular and widely used stone in the Pandora jewelry assortment. Manufactured Responsibily: At Pandora, we believe that responsible business practice and our aspiration to offer high quality jewelry go hand in hand. We re committed to developing and manufacturing responsibly, for our teams, and to minimize our environmental impact on the planet.
