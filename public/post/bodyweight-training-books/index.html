While bodyweight workouts don’t seem as “hard” as lifting weights, you still need rest. “The thought of doing bodyweight exercise may seem like an easier workout, but often this is because people are not as familiar with as many exercise options, and they associate less options with less challenge,” Gagliardi says.Apr 28, 2020\nHow often should you do bodyweight workout?
