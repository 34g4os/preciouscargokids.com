The amount of liquid a sippy cup can hold (often 12 ounces) is way too much for a toddler. Misusing a sippy cup can even make milk (which is normally a very healthy drink) contribute to cavities if your child carries around the sippy cup of milk all day or drinks milk after they brush their teeth at night.Mar 18, 2021\nDo pediatricians recommend sippy cups? Some pediatricians favor using sippy cups during mealtimes only and never allowing them to become comfort objects. The limited scientific literature on the subject says sippy cups are fine if parents are in control of their use, which is a lot easier to do during meals.Jul 15, 2018\nDo sippy cups cause speech problems? Sippy cups – the often character-themed training cups that come with a snap-on lid and hard spout – and/or thumb sucking can cause difficulty with articulation and clarity of speech in some children, says Sandra Holtzman, MS, a speech pathologist and certified orofacial myologist in Coconut Creek, Fla.Feb 12, 2008\nWhy straws are better than sippy cups? A straw cup will help to build lip, cheek, and tongue strength and will promote an appropriate resting position of the tongue for future speech development and a proper swallow pattern. A sippy cup on the other hand will encourage a forward tongue resting position, which often results in a frontal lingual lisp.Jul 15, 2016\nAt what age should you introduce a sippy cup? According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, your little one is likely ready for you to begin introducing sippy cups to him or her between 6 – 9 months old.\nWhat should I introduce to my first sippy cup? Fill it with the familiar. Your baby might take to her sippy cup more readily if it’s filled with a familiar fluid, like breast milk or formula. Or, she may balk at her old favorite coming from a strange new source. In that case, try water or cow’s milk (which you can introduce starting at 1 year).Feb 16, 2021\nHow do you introduce formula to a sippy cup? “The best way I’ve found to make this transition is by putting whatever baby drinks (expressed breast milk or formula) in the sippy cup and only putting water in their bottle,” Crews says. “This makes the sippy cup more desirable than the bottle.” However you choose to do it, stay consistent.\nCan I use a sippy cup instead of a bottle? Spill-proof cups that have spouts designed just for babies (“sippy cups”) can help ease the move from the bottle. Dentists recommend sippy cups with a hard spout or a straw, rather than ones with soft spouts. When your child does use the cup, offer plenty of praise.\nWhen can I give my baby formula in a cup? Most babies are ready to start learning to use a cup at 6 to 9 months of age. This is the same time they start to eat solid food. They need to be able to sit up without support in order to drink from a cup.\nCan I put formula in a straw cup? Can I give my baby formula in a straw cup? According to the AAP, babies are encouraged to start drinking from a cup at the age of 6 months. Though water in the cup at mealtime is perfectly fine to get them used to drinking from a cup, putting formula in the cup works, too.Nov 4, 2021\nWhat cup should a 9 month old use? A cup or a beaker with a free-flow lid (without a non-spill valve) is better than a bottle or beaker with a teat as it will help your baby to learn how to sip rather than suck.\nCan a 9 month old drink from a cup? According to the AAP, age 6-9 months is an ideal time to let your baby experiment with cup drinking. You can do this with sippy cups (see below), or even help your baby drink from an open cup. This is just practice—he’ll be able to use a sippy cup solo by age 1, and an open-cup around age 18 months.Feb 26, 2019\nIs it OK to give a baby formula in a sippy cup? Can you put formula in a sippy cup? Putting formula in a sippy cup is totally fine. The transition to a sippy cup can begin after your child reaches 6 months of age. Using sippy cups promotes good oral hygiene and prevents speech issues that could develop.Sep 25, 2020\nHow do you transition from bottle to sippy cup? Weaning: The idea is to slowly swap out bottles in favor of cups. For example, you might fill in a cup for the bottle at just one feeding a day, then add a second cup the following week. No matter how slow (or fast) you want to go, Ayoob says you should take away the mid-day bottles first, then the morning one.Mar 31, 2022\nCan I give my 9 month old formula from a sippy cup? In general, a baby can start to transition from a bottle to a sippy cup from the age of 6 months. You can put either formula or breastmilk in a sippy cup for your baby, however, there are some important things to consider when giving baby formula or breastmilk in a sippy cup.\nWhen can I introduce milk in a sippy cup? According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, your little one is likely ready for you to begin introducing sippy cups to him or her between 6 – 9 months old.\nCan you give formula in a sippy cup? Can you put formula in a sippy cup? Putting formula in a sippy cup is totally fine. The transition to a sippy cup can begin after your child reaches 6 months of age. Using sippy cups promotes good oral hygiene and prevents speech issues that could develop.Sep 25, 2020\nCan a baby use a sippy cup at 4 months? Your baby probably won’t be able to hold a cup or drink solo without spilling until after age 1, but let them start practicing earlier. The ideal time to introduce a sippy cup—whether with a straw, spouted, or spoutless—is typically around 6 months old, when they start solids.May 13, 2021\nCan I give my baby a sippy cup at 4 months? Your baby probably won’t be able to hold a cup or drink solo without spilling until after age 1, but let them start practicing earlier. The ideal time to introduce a sippy cup—whether with a straw, spouted, or spoutless—is typically around 6 months old, when they start solids.May 13, 2021\nWhat age can you start giving a baby a sippy cup? When and How to Start Introducing Sippy Cups to Your Baby. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, your little one is likely ready for you to begin introducing sippy cups to him or her between 6 – 9 months old.\nShould I put formula in a sippy cup? Can you put formula in a sippy cup? Putting formula in a sippy cup is totally fine. The transition to a sippy cup can begin after your child reaches 6 months of age. Using sippy cups promotes good oral hygiene and prevents speech issues that could develop.Sep 25, 2020\nDo pediatricians recommend sippy cups? Some pediatricians favor using sippy cups during mealtimes only and never allowing them to become comfort objects. The limited scientific literature on the subject says sippy cups are fine if parents are in control of their use, which is a lot easier to do during meals.Jul 15, 2018\nWhen should a baby use a sippy cup? While most people don’t think about it, you can introduce a straw cup or sippy cup as early as six months of age (or even earlier if you and baby will be apart for a feeding and baby is not interested in the bottle). However, most parents introduce a sippy cup or straw around 12 months of age.\nIs a straw or sippy cup better? The spout in a sippy cup ultimately prohibits the tongue’s range of motion similar to a traditional feeding bottle. The muscles used for drinking from a straw develop better swallowing patterns. Because of the specific placement of the straw in the mouth, there is a stronger development of oral motor skills.\nIs a sippy cup better than a bottle? Around 12 months your child’s swallow begins to mature and the continued used of a bottle or introduction of a hard-spouted sippy cup can interfere with progression from that infant suckle to a more mature swallow pattern. This is why we recommend ditching the bottle by 12 months of age and moving to a straw cup!May 2, 2018\n",

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-sippy-cups">What&rsquo;s wrong with sippy cups?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-wrong-with-sippy-cups">#</a></h2>
<p>The amount of liquid a sippy cup can hold (often 12 ounces) is way too much for a toddler. Misusing a sippy cup can even make milk (which is normally a very healthy drink) contribute to cavities if your child carries around the sippy cup of milk all day or drinks milk after they brush their teeth at night.Mar 18, 2021</p>
<h2 id="do-pediatricians-recommend-sippy-cups">Do pediatricians recommend sippy cups?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#do-pediatricians-recommend-sippy-cups">#</a></h2>
<p>Some pediatricians favor using sippy cups during mealtimes only and never allowing them to become comfort objects. The limited scientific literature on the subject says sippy cups are fine if parents are in control of their use, which is a lot easier to do during meals.Jul 15, 2018</p>
<h2 id="do-sippy-cups-cause-speech-problems">Do sippy cups cause speech problems?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#do-sippy-cups-cause-speech-problems">#</a></h2>
<p>Sippy cups &ndash; the often character-themed training cups that come with a snap-on lid and hard spout &ndash; and/or thumb sucking can cause difficulty with articulation and clarity of speech in some children, says Sandra Holtzman, MS, a speech pathologist and certified orofacial myologist in Coconut Creek, Fla.Feb 12, 2008</p>

<p>A straw cup will help to build lip, cheek, and tongue strength and will promote an appropriate resting position of the tongue for future speech development and a proper swallow pattern.

<p>Fill it with the familiar. Your baby might take to her sippy cup more readily if it&rsquo;s filled with a familiar fluid, like breast milk or formula. Or, she may balk at her old favorite coming from a strange new source. In that case, try water or cow&rsquo;s milk (which you can introduce starting at 1 year).Feb 16, 2021</p>

<p>“The best way I&rsquo;ve found to make this transition is by putting whatever baby drinks (expressed breast milk or formula) in the sippy cup and only putting water in their bottle,” Crews says. “This makes the sippy cup more desirable than the bottle.” However you choose to do it, stay consistent.</p>

<p>According to the AAP, age 6-9 months is an ideal time to let your baby experiment with cup drinking. You can do this with sippy cups (see below), or even help your baby drink from an open cup. This is just practice—he&rsquo;ll be able to use a sippy cup solo by age 1, and an open-cup around age 18 months.Feb 26, 2019</p>

<p>Weaning: The idea is to slowly swap out bottles in favor of cups. For example, you might fill in a cup for the bottle at just one feeding a day, then add a second cup the following week. No matter how slow (or fast) you want to go, Ayoob says you should take away the mid-day bottles first, then the morning one.Mar 31, 2022</p>

<p>Some pediatricians favor using sippy cups during mealtimes only and never allowing them to become comfort objects. The limited scientific literature on the subject says sippy cups are fine if parents are in control of their use, which is a lot easier to do during meals.Jul 15, 2018</p>

<p>While most people don&rsquo;t think about it, you can introduce a straw cup or sippy cup as early as six months of age (or even earlier if you and baby will be apart for a feeding and baby is not interested in the bottle). However, most parents introduce a sippy cup or straw around 12 months of age.</p>

<p>The spout in a sippy cup ultimately prohibits the tongue&rsquo;s range of motion similar to a traditional feeding bottle. The muscles used for drinking from a straw develop better swallowing patterns. Because of the specific placement of the straw in the mouth, there is a stronger development of oral motor skills.</p>

<p>Around 12 months your child&rsquo;s swallow begins to mature and the continued used of a bottle or introduction of a hard-spouted sippy cup can interfere with progression from that infant suckle to a more mature swallow pattern. This is why we recommend ditching the bottle by 12 months of age and moving to a straw cup!May 2, 2018</p>
