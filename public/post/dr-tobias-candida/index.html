                RELIEVE SYMPTOMS CAUSED BY CANDIDA OVERGROWTH - Find relief for yeast imbalance complaints such as: Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, joint pain, recurring infections (digestive, urinary, skin/nail, oral), itching, sugar cravings, bloating, and more. CANDIDA COMPLEX TO ADDRESS YEAST IMBALANCE - Candid-X is formulated to assist in balancing intestinal flora. The GI tract is home to many organisms and not all are beneficial. A quality formula of botanicals and supportive nutrients, combined with improvements in diet, can go a long way in helping to reverse dysbiosis and balance microflora. COMPLEMENT PROBIOTICS, TAKE AFTER ANTIBIOTICS - When taking gut health seriously, you may use enzymes, probiotics, and more. Candid-X has the potency to support the work those products are doing, by knocking down the troublesome yeast. And after taking antibiotics, gut flora imbalance is inevitable. Restore the good balance - and prevent imbalance - with the help of a Candida fighter like this. PROVEN INGREDIENTS IN HIGH AMOUNTS - Look no further for a rich and potent blend, which includes sodium caprylate, berberine, oregano, cinnamon, chamomile, ginger, Pau D arco, and rosemary. These are all ingredients shown in numerous studies to inhibit fungi growth. MADE IN THE USA - All BioMatrix products are made in the USA in a cGMP facility using high quality raw materials.
