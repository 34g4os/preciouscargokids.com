                WEATHERPROOF PAPER: 84 pages / 42 sheets per side spiral notepad. All-weather paper won’t turn to mush when wet and will repel water, sweat, grease, mud, and even survive the accidental laundry mishap. Make sure your pocket notebook stays RIGHT in the Rain. WIRE-O BINDING: Tough impact-resistant Wire-O binding won t lose its shape in your backpack or book bag. Unlike a standard spiral notebook, Wire-O keeps your open pages aligned and intact. WRITE IN THE RAIN: When wet, use a standard pencil like a #2 Ticonderoga or an all-weather pen like a Fisher Space Pen. Standard ballpoints and permanent markers will work when paper is dry. Water-based inks like gel pens will bead up and wash off Rite in the Rain Paper. WATERPROOF NOTEBOOK COVER: Polydura material creates a tough but flexible outer shell. Whether you re needing a hiking journal, outfitting your police gear, starting a golf journal, or just keeping a shower notebook, the Polydura cover material will defend your field notes from scratches and stains. RECYCLABILITY: Unlike synthetic waterproof paper, wood-based Rite in the Rain is completely recyclable. Please recycle Rite in the Rain as you would other office printer paper.
