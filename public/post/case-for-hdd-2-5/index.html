Hard drives come in two basic physical sizes: 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch. These sizes refer to the size of the data platters, not the size of the hard drive mechanism. Traditionally, 2.5-inch drives are used for laptops while 3.5-inch drives are used for desktop computers.\nWhat size is a 2.5 HDD? A 2.5-inch SATA hard drive actually measures 2.7 inches wide, 0.37 inch tall, and 3.96 inches long.

The have different storage capacity, speeds, form factors and connectors.” This is a “truthy” statement.Jan 5, 2019\nAre all laptop HDD the same size? The good news is that almost all laptop hard drives are the same size and use some form of a SATA interface. Naturally, make sure that the drive’s capacity is as big or bigger than the drive you’re replacing.

<p>Hard drives come in two basic physical sizes: 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch. These sizes refer to the size of the data platters, not the size of the hard drive mechanism. Traditionally, 2.5-inch drives are used for laptops while 3.5-inch drives are used for desktop computers.</p>

<p>A 2.5-inch SATA hard drive actually measures 2.7 inches wide, 0.37 inch tall, and 3.96 inches long. According to The Tech Report, the 2.5-inch designation actually refers to the size of a typical laptop drive platter, the disc inside the housing that data is actually recorded on.</p>

<p>The good news is that almost all laptop hard drives are the same size and use some form of a SATA interface. Naturally, make sure that the drive&rsquo;s capacity is as big or bigger than the drive you&rsquo;re replacing. You want to make sure that you have at least as much room as you had before.Jul 5, 2013</p>

<p>Yes, the connectors are the same and it should work. The problem, however, is using it instead of a 2.5&quot; drive in a laptop (won&rsquo;t fit).Feb 7, 2018</p>

<p>Standard 2.5&quot; drives are 9.5mm, but some of the thinner laptops may use a 7mm one, which would mean that a drive with 9.5mm height won&rsquo;t fit in that slot. Caching basically makes the drive faster by storing data which you might use next. The more the cache, the more the available space to store such data.Mar 30, 2016</p>

<p>The largest difference between 2.5 and 3.5 inch hard drives is their size. Two and a half inch hard drives aren&rsquo;t just narrower. They&rsquo;re also shorter and thinner, which makes them popular for laptop computers while desktop business computers typically use 3.5 inch drives.</p>

<p>The drive offers more throughput than our 3.5” Fujitsu comparison drive, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance against the latest 15,000 RPM drives with regard to throughput. I/O performance is mainly determined by the rotation speed and the resulting rotational latency.Apr 18, 2010</p>

<p>Even at the same speed a 2.5 inch drive is slower . A LOT slower . The reason is simply that the amount of recording track that passes under a read head in each rotation is way less . Even in the best case scenario the 2.5 inch drive will be a minimum of 25% slower .Jun 7, 2015</p>

<p>Glorious. no they are the same. 2.5 inch drives will often include power with the data cable as one unit, 2.5 inch drives use less power and can be powered by USB. a 3.5 inch drive needs more power and will have a dedicated power cable.Sep 13, 2017</p>

<p>Standard 2.5&quot; drives are 9.5mm, but some of the thinner laptops may use a 7mm one, which would mean that a drive with 9.5mm height won&rsquo;t fit in that slot. Caching basically makes the drive faster by storing data which you might use next. The more the cache, the more the available space to store such data.</p>
