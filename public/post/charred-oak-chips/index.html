                This sale is for all charred 100% natural and organic, heartwood (center) American White Oak. The wood was put in a commercial kitchen oven for 4 hrs at 350 degrees, then charred under a commercial kitchen broiler. Hand cut by manual saw and hatchet. No gas chain saw or gear oiled blades. Suitable wood for human consumption. I ve been an Executive Chef in a large restaurant for 18 years, and I am Serve-safe certified in food and beverage handling and sanitation, so you know your wood was handled professionally. I harvested this wood myself, so you know that its not red oak, Pin oak, or other unfavorable species of oak.

<p>Normally, the wood is cut into strips called staves and cross stacked out in the weather for 1 to 3 years. This does two things: 1) it dries the wood out; 2) it leaches out the unwanted sap and other impurities. The cross stacks are re-stacked from time to time. This is to even out the effects of the weathering.Dec 13, 2020</p>

<p>The reason that Oak is utilized is its unique physical and chemical nature. Oak has strength – physically, its wide radial rays give strength when shaped for a cask. Oak is also a “pure wood” as opposed to pine or rubber trees which contain resin canals that can pass strong flavors to maturing whisky.Jan 16, 2014</p>

<p>White oak&rsquo;s cellular structure allows small amounts of oxygen to permeate barrel staves and diffuse its contents.
