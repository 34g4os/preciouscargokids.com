Over time the gears start weaing out and the valve is not able to rotate anymore. Another common problem could be the motor going bad. 🛡️ INSTALL WITH EASE: After making sure the valve actuator is malfunctioning, remove the 4 screws holding it in place. When installing the new one make sure the valve switch is not off and make sure the valve is locked. If it is not locked then the valve actuator will rotate in 360 degrees. 💰 EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY: These aftermarket replacement parts for Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy Zodiac are made by Swimables and are of the same or better quality compared to the originals parts. They are made to last in any weather condition. ☑️ 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE: Buy with confidence, as our premium quality Pentair Heater Igniter Replacement is built to last, and if you re not satisfied with it at any time within 30 days of purchase, we ll provide a refund or replacement.\rFree shipping\rDetails\rIntermatic PE24VA Valve Actuator, Black\r561 Reviews\rAutomates compatible 2-way and 3-way diverter valves For pool/spa combinations and easy-to-adjust cam rotates valves to multiple settings For pool/water feature combinations Adjustable cam rotates diverter valves to multiple degree settings Retro fits into all pool/spa control systems on the market\rFree shipping\rDetails\rJandy 4717 3-Port 2 to 2-1/2-Inch Positive Seal NeverLube Valve\r972 Reviews\rDistributor Packaging Designed for easy automation Made from durable CPVC Proprietary NeverLube technology Maintenance free\rFree shipping\rDetails\rFILTPOOL FP-33145, Jandy CL580 CV580, R0357900, A0104100, Pleatco PJAN145, Unicel C-7482, Filbur FC-0820, FC-6415, 4Pack\r11 Reviews\rJandy CL580, CV580, A0104100, R0357900 FAST Shipping most orders ship at the same business day Dimensions of the Filter: 33” L, 7” OD, 3” ID FiltPool Model: FP-33145 Made in North America\rFree shipping\rDetails\rSwimables Valve Insert Replacement for All Jandy 2 Way and 3 Way Valves - Neverlube Diverter Valve Kit 4720 Replacement for Zodiac 2 Port or 3 Port\r366 Reviews\rPerfect Fit: Fits all Jandy NeverLube 2 and 3 Port Valves and Jandy Gray 2 and 3 Port Valves.

                🌊 MADE TO WORK WITH PENTAIR, JANDY, AND HAYWARD POOL AND SPA AUTOMATION SYSTEMS: The Swimables Replacement Valve Actuator is made to work with all major brands including Pentair, Jandy/ Zodiac and Hayward Automation Systems.

Over time the gears start weaing out and the valve is not able to rotate anymore. Another common problem could be the motor going bad. 🛡️ INSTALL WITH EASE: After making sure the valve actuator is malfunctioning, remove the 4 screws holding it in place. When installing the new one make sure the valve switch is not off and make sure the valve is locked. If it is not locked then the valve actuator will rotate in 360 degrees. 💰 EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY: These aftermarket replacement parts for Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy Zodiac are made by Swimables and are of the same or better quality compared to the originals parts.

<p>Well-known member. You can simply move the valve using the toggle switch if the limits provide full movement. When it is in the correct position, return the toggle to the middle position. Leave it there until you work is done than put toggle back in original position so valve will return to normal running position.Jul 1, 2020</p>
