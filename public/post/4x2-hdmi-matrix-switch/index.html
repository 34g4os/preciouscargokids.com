<p>The prime reason to get an HDMI switch is if your TV, AV receiver or soundbar has too few inputs for the number of sources you have. For instance, your TV has two HDMI inputs and you have a cable box, a Roku, and an Xbox.Sep 11, 2021</p>

<p>Functionality Difference An HDMI splitter accepts one source and casts it on more than one television screen. An HDMI switch, on the other hand, takes more one than source, and then sends it to one device or T.V. via the cable output.</p>

<p>HDMI switches are the traffic lights at the intersection of all your HDMI device inputs. The HDMI switch allows all signals to be present and active, but only allows one to pass through to the TV at a time.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get into more detail, but the short version is that an HDMI switch takes multiple sources and lets you choose (switch) between them, sending one cable to your TV. As you&rsquo;ve probably figured out already, a splitter takes one signal and splits it across multiple HDMI cables.Sep 11, 2021</p>
