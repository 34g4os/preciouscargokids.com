Cool iron on reverse. Wash dark colours separately. Remove immediately if product becomes wet or damp. KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE HOW to operate: we use matching shade invisible zipper back on the pillowcase closure for an elegant look, easy insertion and washing. WHERE to use: Wide applications, perfect for sofa, bay window, bed, travel and naps. It’s a classy and elegant made pillow and a great addition to ANY room or décor style! OTHERS: Because of the electrostatic. In winter, the phenomenon of fabric stickiness will be obviously, and the darker the color, the more obvious it is. It would be reduces time and effort that just clean hair effectively with wide adhesive tape.

                【MATERIAL】Made of 100% premium quality French flax fabric with pre washed, 160 GSM (For making the fabric soft, the pre-washing process will cause an uncontrollable shrinkage, so the final GSM will have 5% more or less deviation). Certified by OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 for environmentally friendly, responsible and sustainable fabric production. 【PACKAGE INCLUDE】26  X 26  basic style Euro Shams pack of 2. Covers only, no pillow insert. 【OVERLAP CLOSURE DESIGN】The euro pillow cover has an delicate opening at the middle of back. Unique designed envelope overlap closure can cover, protect and keep your pillow clean and in place. 【CARE INSTRUCTION】Wash prior to first use. Gentle cycle washing under 60℃ with similar colors. Do not use detergent that contains bleach or whitener. Line dry or tumble dry on medium heat. Warm iron if needed. Do not dry clean. Linen fabric will become softer after every washing. 【DISTINCTIVE HOME DECORATION】Create a wonderful classic bedroom space with our Washed Linen Collection. Duvet covers, sheet sets, bed skirts and linen pillowcases are all available to make your bed fantasy. If you have any problem, feel free to contact us, we provide 24/7 customer service : )

<p>Euro pillows are typically 26 inches by 26 inches and Euro shams are made to fit over them. They play the same role as other-sized bed shams, just for a nontraditional-sized pillow.
