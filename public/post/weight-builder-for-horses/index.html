                Empower your horse s metabolism to build optimum definition and muscle mass. Combines four natural ingredients that synergistically encourage muscle-building metabolic reactions. Lysine, an amino acid, aids in developing muscle-building proteins; Gamma oryzanol encourages weight gain and muscle formation. Creatine helps supply energy to muscle cells by stepping up production of ATP; Ornithine-A-Ketoglutarate (OKG) helps the body bypass metabolic processes that prevent new muscle development. Formulated and manufactured by John Ewing Company in Colorado, USA, where we ve been Helping Horses Succeed Since 1946

<p>One of the simplest and cheapest ways to add fat to your horse&rsquo;s diet is vegetable oil from the grocery store, which can be poured over his regular concentrate ration. Corn oil is palatable to most horses, but you can also use canola, peanut or any other vegetable oil your horse likes.</p>

<p>Vegetable oils, such as corn or soybean oil, are more palatable than processed animal fat. Rice bran is another high-fat source that is both palatable and effective in horse diets. The horse can consume a concentrate mix with as much as 15 percent added fat without palatability or digestive problems such as diarrhea.Jan 20, 2020</p>
