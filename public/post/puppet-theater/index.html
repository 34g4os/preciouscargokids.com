                This puppet theater goes up in a jiffy. An adjustable top rod fits standard doorways and additional rods keep the curtain taut and hanging straight. A whimsical castle scene sets the stage for creative play. Time to grab your puppets (sold separately) and let your imaginations run wild! Use the practical oval pocket for custom signage i.e. the name of your show and upcoming showtimes! Red Polka dot curtains tie back to highlight the show. Pop a character out the porthole window above and keep your audience on their toes. Winner of the ASTRA Best Toys for Kids Award 2014 and Parent s Choice Silver Award. Machine washable on cold. Air dry. The theater dimensions are 67  tall and 31  wide, but the poles extend a bit further (up to 45 ) for larger door frames.
