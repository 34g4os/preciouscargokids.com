Definition of bookholder : a device that supports a book — compare bookrack, bookrest.\nHow do you keep thick books open? Just take a large rubber band that will fit over the book from side to side and once you have the page you want….slip the elastic over the book near the top. You can increase the number of elastics for larger books or slip a chop stick under the elastic for more rigidity and stiffness.Dec 25, 2016\nHow can I stay awake while reading in bed? Use extra lighting to reduce eye strain. Also make sure that the temperature isn’t too hot. Reading in an environment that’s too warm can make you sleepy in a hurry. If you anticipate trouble staying awake and you really need to finish that book before bed, try waking yourself up before you start reading.\nHow can I stay awake while reading in bed?

<p>There&rsquo;s an age-old reason why reading a book in bed is part of so many children&rsquo;s nighttime routines: reading puts us in the right headspace for a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Similar to how physical exercise strengthens the body, cognitive exercises — like reading — are important to strengthen the mind.</p>

<p>The Benefits of Reading in Bed Reading can help reduce anxiety because it distracts us. And that&rsquo;s no small feat: When dealing with anxiety, distraction from life stressors is a reasonable, evidence-based intervention. It&rsquo;s also relaxing, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re battling anxiety or just battling too much stress.Mar 26, 2022</p>

<p>—Joyce Walsleben, PhD, Sleep ExpertReading in bed isn&rsquo;t always a problem, but if it doesn&rsquo;t ease you into sleep, you should stop. For some people, &ldquo;reading may be more fun than sleeping,&rdquo; says Walsleben. If it&rsquo;s keeping you up, take your reading somewhere else—and leave it there.Feb 29, 2016</p>

<p>Just take a large rubber band that will fit over the book from side to side and once you have the page you want&hellip;.slip the elastic over the book near the top. You can increase the number of elastics for larger books or slip a chop stick under the elastic for more rigidity and stiffness.Dec 25, 2016</p>

<p>Use extra lighting to reduce eye strain. Also make sure that the temperature isn&rsquo;t too hot. Reading in an environment that&rsquo;s too warm can make you sleepy in a hurry. If you anticipate trouble staying awake and you really need to finish that book before bed, try waking yourself up before you start reading.</p>
