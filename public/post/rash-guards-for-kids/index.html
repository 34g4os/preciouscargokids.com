<p>If you are a surfer, odds are you have a rash guard in your wardrobe, and you may be wondering if it is appropriate to wear when you go swimming. The answer is yes — a rash guard can be used for swimming, though it may not be as comfortable as other options.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-wear-something-under-a-rash-guard">Do you wear something under a rash guard?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#do-you-wear-something-under-a-rash-guard">#</a></h2>
<p>What do you wear under a rash guard or swim shirt? Women typically wear a swim suit top or one piece swimsuit under a rash guard or swim shirt for extra modesty. However, it&rsquo;s all a matter of personal comfort.</p>

<p>Rash guards provide added coverage to protect against the sun&rsquo;s harmful rays and help prevent sunburn. Some rash guards even include UPF 50+ properties for built-in UV protection, but remember to still use sunscreen.</p>

<p>“UPF clothing is more effective at protecting skin from UV rays than sunscreens and does not wear off and does not require reapplication,” says Dr. Adigun. You don&rsquo;t need to wear sunscreen under UPF clothing, and that goes for rash guards made for water activities.Jun 11, 2021</p>

<p>Do toddlers need rash guards? Rash guards are an excellent idea for toddlers and little kids, especially, because they offer extra coverage from the sun (which can easily burn that delicate skin). Pair it with a shady sun hat, and don&rsquo;t forget the beach towels!Apr 6, 2020</p>

<p>For additional protection against UV rays, consider choosing a baby swimsuit made with UPF fabrics. A long-sleeve one-piece swimsuit is a great choice for babies 6-12 months old because it provides warmth and coverage.</p>

<p>A long-sleeve UPF 50 toddler rash guard will keep the sun off your baby&rsquo;s shoulders, back, and chest. You should also bring extra protective gear like a wide-brimmed beach hat and sunshades so that your baby has somewhere cool to relax. When babies get older, they become little walkers and love to explore.</p>
