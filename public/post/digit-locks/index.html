<p>To open combination locks without a code, start by pulling up on the dial and turning it clockwise until you hear the lock click. Then, check what number you&rsquo;re at, add 5 to that number, and write it down. Next, set the dial to that number and turn it counterclockwise until you hear it click again.</p>
