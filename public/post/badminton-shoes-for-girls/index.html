You can play Badminton bare-footed but I wouldnâ€™t suggest it as you canâ€™t move and jump freely as youâ€™ll be concentrating on your feet and youâ€™ll not feel comfortable after those high jump smashes and wonâ€™t be able to pick up in case the opponent reverses your smash in most scenarios.\nCan I play badminton with normal shoes? As long as the shoes have good grip, are comfortable and donâ€™t hurt your feet â€“ apart from the not leaving marks or scratches â€“ then your shoes are just fine. For badminton you do need shoes that allow your feet to move forwards, backwards and also laterally.\nCan I play badminton with slippers? Of course you can. Just that it is not recommended. As most other sports Badminton also requires a special footwear.\nWhat is the importance of shoes in badminton? In badminton you are likely to occasionally slide as you move side to side â€“ this means you need a shoe that offers support and protects your ankles.

The major differences comes from their soles, flexibility, and center of gravity. Badminton shoes are more delicate since their soles are softer and wear out quicker. Finally, you should never wear them interchangeably as it can get dangerous, especially using running shoes to play badminton.Aug 17, 2020\nWhat type of shoes are best for badminton?

<p>You can play Badminton bare-footed but I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest it as you can&rsquo;t move and jump freely as you&rsquo;ll be concentrating on your feet and you&rsquo;ll not feel comfortable after those high jump smashes and won&rsquo;t be able to pick up in case the opponent reverses your smash in most scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-play-badminton-with-normal-shoes">Can I play badminton with normal shoes?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-i-play-badminton-with-normal-shoes">#</a></h2>
<p>As long as the shoes have good grip, are comfortable and don&rsquo;t hurt your feet â€“ apart from the not leaving marks or scratches â€“ then your shoes are just fine. For badminton you do need shoes that allow your feet to move forwards, backwards and also laterally.</p>

<p>Of course you can. Just that it is not recommended. As most other sports Badminton also requires a special footwear.</p>

<p>In badminton you are likely to occasionally slide as you move side to side â€“ this means you need a shoe that offers support and protects your ankles. When you are moving fast across a hard court, the friction can lead to blisters on your skin â€“ proper badminton shoes make it less likely that you will develop blisters.</p>

<p>Ideally you should be looking for neutral shoes with a relatively thin sole which keeps you stable and low to the ground. Cushioning throughout the foot will reduce the chance of injuries and strain when landing from high jumps. Your badminton shoes should not slow you down.</p>

<p>Badminton shoes aren&rsquo;t necessary, but they are recommended, especially when playing on a wooden or synthetic indoor court. This is because badminton shoes are designed to have a good grip on the court without leaving any markings on them. In addition, you will get better support and comfort.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-identify-badminton-shoes">How do I identify badminton shoes?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-i-identify-badminton-shoes">#</a></h2>
<p>Drag your foot with the heel across the paper and examine the paper for a marking. If you do not see a mark, you have non-marking soles. Although shoes with black soles are more likely to leave marks than those with light soles, non-marking black-soled shoes are available.</p>

<p>If you are going to use a wooden court or a synthetic court, you most definitely need to buy badminton shoes. They come with specialized gum rubber soles that do not leave scuff marks on the wooden court. This ensures that your experience is not ruined by damaged premises.Aug 27, 2021</p>

<p>You can play Badminton bare-footed but I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest it as you can&rsquo;t move and jump freely as you&rsquo;ll be concentrating on your feet and you&rsquo;ll not feel comfortable after those high jump smashes and won&rsquo;t be able to pick up in case the opponent reverses your smash in most scenarios.</p>

<p>The major differences comes from their soles, flexibility, and center of gravity. Badminton shoes are more delicate since their soles are softer and wear out quicker. Finally, you should never wear them interchangeably as it can get dangerous, especially using running shoes to play badminton.Aug 17, 2020</p>

<p>You can play with normal rubber soled shoes on cement courts. Wood or PU courts require badminton shoes with gum rubber soles, that provide high levels of traction and grip.</p>

<p>If you are going to use a wooden court or a synthetic court, you most definitely need to buy badminton shoes. They come with specialized gum rubber soles that do not leave scuff marks on the wooden court. This ensures that your experience is not ruined by damaged premises.Aug 27, 2021</p>

<p>If you are like most players playing on wooden or rubber-floored courts, a gum rubber sole is what you need. Otherwise, any rubber sole will do. Rubber soles are much harder than gum rubber, but they do not provide enough traction on rubber or wooden courts.</p>

<p>Badminton shoes aren&rsquo;t necessary, but they are recommended, especially when playing on a wooden or synthetic indoor court. This is because badminton shoes are designed to have a good grip on the court without leaving any markings on them. In addition, you will get better support and comfort.</p>

<p>For Badminton, wear shorts or a skirt with a light synthetic sports T-shirt. Avoid tracksuit pants or long-sleeved T-shirts as you need to be able to move freely. Avoid cotton materials for any of these. If you&rsquo;re going to be playing regularly then have a pair of quality Badminton shoes in your bag.</p>

<p>In badminton you are likely to occasionally slide as you move side to side â€“ this means you need a shoe that offers support and protects your ankles. When you are moving fast across a hard court, the friction can lead to blisters on your skin â€“ proper badminton shoes make it less likely that you will develop blisters.</p>
