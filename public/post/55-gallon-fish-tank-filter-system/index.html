                NOTHING LIKE OLD SCHOOL: The Clear-Free Premium Under Gravel Filter is air driven and utilizes an Air Pump (not included) to cycle crystal clear water throughout your aquarium, while keeping a crisp and neat look inside. This means there‚Äôs less ‚Äúmoving parts,‚Äù making for simplistic and easy maintenance. This filter is suitable for most 40 ‚Äì 55 gallon aquariums. BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL, AND PHYSICAL FILTRATION: As air is pushed through the Air Stones and rises through the Lift Tubes, water is gently suctioned through gravel and the filter plates, allowing both air and water to pass through the Filt-a-Carb Activated Carbon Cartridges. When water continues to be drawn through, anaerobic bacteria collects and colonizes within the gravel and filter plates. ALSO AERATES YOUR TANK: Since the Clear-Free Premium Under Gravel Filter is air driven through the use of Air Stones and an Air Pump (not included), it also aerates your tank. In essence, your aquarium is being filtered and aerated at the same time, though the same system! It‚Äôs a filter and bubbler in 1! ITEMS INCLUDED: The Clear-Free Premium Under Gravel Filter includes 4 Filter Plates, 4 Adjustable Lift Tubes, 4 Straight Airline Tubes, 9 Filter Plate Connecters, and 4 Replaceable Filt-a-Carb Activated Carbon Media Cartridges. MEASUREMENTS: Each Filter Plate Separately = 11.25‚Äù (W) x 11.25‚Äù (D) / Filter Plates Together = 45‚Äù (W) x 11.25‚Äù (D) / Each Lift Tube at Filter Plate Base = 13.25‚Äù ‚Äì 16.5‚Äù

                üêü„ÄêBiochemical Filtration„ÄëThis fish tank filter has three stages of filter boxes with biochemical cotton and activated carbon inside, can collect and filter the waste in water, make wave and circular flow, help to culture beneficial bacteria, create a healthy water environment for your fishes and turtles. The biochemical cotton is washable and reusable. üêü„ÄêIncrease Oxygen„ÄëThe air inlet on the aquarium filter will increase oxygen level of the filtered water, make the fish more active. Also, a good supply of oxygen helps culture beneficial bacteria like nitrifying bacteria. You can adjust the oxygen supply by spinning the valve of air inlet. P.S.: The valve of the oxygen inlet should be placed outside the fish tank and contact with air. üêü„ÄêUltra Quiet„ÄëUsing Dimension: 6‚Äô‚Äô(L) x 2.5‚Äô‚Äô(W) x 13.8‚Äô‚Äô(H). Premium pump motor is noiseless during operation. It is only 35 dB, almost like the whisper or the sound in a quiet library. We recommend to turn off the spin button and stop the air inlet process at night, so that the filter pump will be more quiet. This way, it will not affect the operation of the filtration. üêü„ÄêDetachable Filter Boxes„ÄëThe 3 filter boxes are detachable so that you can adjust the number of filter boxes according to the fish tank height. Suitable for fish tank 40 to 150 gallon no more than 58 inches height. Put the aquarium filter vertically in fish tank, or lay down horizontally in turtle tank of low water level. You can also detach all the filter boxes and connect the water outlet with a hose, them it can be used as a water pump. üêü„ÄêEasy to Clean„ÄëIt is very convenient to take out the biochemical cotton and wash it, or your can replace with other filter medium. Hikpeed Official offers 180-days warranty. If you have any questions about our products, please feel free to contact us and we will do our best to solve your problems.

<p>An aquarium can be over-filtered because large filters have large pumps that can move the water too quickly. When the water is cycled at an excessive rate, spread sediment all over the tank, push the fish around, and more.</p>
<h2 id="what-size-filter-should-i-use-for-a-55-gallon-aquarium">What size filter should I use for a 55 gallon aquarium?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-size-filter-should-i-use-for-a-55-gallon-aquarium">#</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s recommended that you get a filter with a GPH that is at least four times your tank volume. For example, for a 55 gallon tank, you want a GPH of at least 220.Jan 5, 2022</p>

<p>Starting with filtration, you will need to know: Simply multiply the tank&rsquo;s length x width x height / 1000. The result will equal how many litres of water your fish tank holds. Example: You have a fish tank that measure 150 centimetres in length, 55 centimetres in width, and 55 centimetres tall.Apr 9, 2019</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s recommended that you get a filter with a GPH that is at least four times your tank volume. For example, for a 55 gallon tank, you want a GPH of at least 220.Jan 5, 2022</p>

<p>Canister filters are much more reliable when it comes to filtration for saltwater and planted aquariums. They work equally as well for freshwater tanks, too. These types of filters st outside of the tank and use hoses submerged in the tank to filter the water.Aug 4, 2021</p>

<p>As long as the filter will move the entire volume of water in the tank it will be good enough. You could put a filter rated 2x&rsquo;s the size of the tank or 10x&rsquo;s the size of the tank, it will still only grow enough bacteria to handle the current bio-load of the tank and no more.Oct 20, 2015</p>

<p>As a minimum, your filter should be able to clean at least four times the size of your aquarium per hour. For example, a filter for a 40-gallon tank should have a water flow rate of at least 180 GPH (gallons per hour). Reef tanks and setups with large species of fish will require a higher water flow rate.</p>

<p>Tanks that are 2.5 gallons or smaller, shouldn&rsquo;t have a filter because they can do more harm than good. Filters in small tanks cause strong currents, which can toss a betta fish around and stress them out.</p>

<p>It is one of the most popular filters for the aquarium. The canister filter has many benefits more than a power filter, especially in terms of performance. It gives the best result without any loss of water or fish. However, it requires a lot of effort to make it work properly, but it is worth it.</p>

<p>Canister filters are aquarium filters that remove the water from the fish tank through an intake tube, sieve, or valve, run it through filter media in a pressurized canister, and then pump the filtered aquarium water back into the fish tank via spill way or spray bar.</p>

<p>What Size Pump for a 55 Gallon Aquarium? A 55 gallon freshwater aquarium will need a pump with a flow rate of at least 275 GPH (gallons per hour). A planted 55 gallon aquarium should use a pump with a flow rate of 220 GPH.</p>

<p>GPH stands for gallons per hour. It&rsquo;s a measure of how much water the filter pump can move in an hour. It&rsquo;s recommended that you get a filter with a GPH that is at least four times your tank volume. For example, for a 55 gallon tank, you want a GPH of at least 220.Jan 5, 2022</p>

<p>Calculate Your Recommended Flow Rate For reef aquariums, the general rule among hobbyists is to choose a pump that can provide a turnover/flow rate of 5x to 10x the tank volume per hour. For example, a return pump for a 50-gallon tank would equal a flow rate of 250-500 GPH.</p>

<p>Divide the timed rate by 60 to find the gallon per minute rate: 60 divided by 15 equals 4. Multiply the gallon per minute rate by 60 to find the gph rate: 4 times 60 equals 240 gph. Don&rsquo;t forget to disconnect the tubing and restart the pump so it is back into use for the aquarium.Oct 12, 2019</p>

<p>The motors are much bigger than hang-on-the-backs and have a lot more power. Pro Tip: Generally, it&rsquo;s recommended that your filter have a GPH that&rsquo;s at least four times the capacity of your tank. So, for a 55 gallon tank you&rsquo;d want a GPH of at least 220.</p>

<p>A 55 gallon aquarium needs a pump with a flow rate of at least 275 GPH. A pump with a flow rate of 220 GPH should be used for a 55 gallon aquarium.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to select a filter with a flow rate at least six times the volume of the tank‚Äîso for a 30-gallon tank you want a flow rate of about 200 gph (gallons per hour).</p>
