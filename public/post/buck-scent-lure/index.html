During the rut doe estrus is by far the best scent to be using if you’re hunting bucks. Bucks go crazy when they think they smell a doe ready to mate and will take a lot of risks to find her.\nWhat does deer estrus smell like? These chemical signals are how big bucks tell if a doe is in heat. While they smell like pure lust to that trophy whitetail, to us they just smell like ass. This is the meaning of doe in heat, the complete picture of all the secretions she produces during her estrous period.\n",

<p>An estrous-based scent smells like a doe that&rsquo;s ready to breed. Bucks cover lots of ground searching for that odor, so use it to your advantage.

<p>While deer-based lures may advertise that they&rsquo;re just as good as the real thing, it may not be the case.

So urine, feces, and any other miscellaneous materials may gather in the collection area.Jan 4, 2017</p>
