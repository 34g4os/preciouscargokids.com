The Apple Smart Battery Case has been superseded by the MagSafe Battery Pack, released in July 2021. Apple introduced the Apple Smart Battery Case in December 2015. It entered the market as Apple’s attempt at a portable and always-available alternative power source for the iPhone.\nAre charging cases safe for iPhone? Answer: A: As long as the battery case you buy is Made for iPhone certified, it should be fine. I’ve been using the mophie wireless charging battery case on my 7+ since I bought it and on my iPhone 6 for a year before that. Don’t go cheap on anything that involves charging your phone.Jun 2, 2017\nDo charging cases ruin your battery? However, keeping the case on while your phone is charging might actually be doing harm to your battery. Heat is bad for batteries, and by leaving your phone case on while it charges you are trapping the heat that is being generated. Take your phone case off when you plug it in to give your phone a little fresh air.\nIs it better to charge without case? It is recommended that you remove the phone’s protective case while charging. It is natural for the battery to become slightly warm, but the case may act as a barrier and slow down heat dissipation. If possible, flip the phone over and place it on a soft cloth to protect the display.Nov 2, 2020\nIs iPhone charging case worth it? The Smart Battery Case was able to easily keep my iPhone XR charged at 100 percent for an entire day of rather heavy use.

<p>The Apple Smart Battery Case has been superseded by the MagSafe Battery Pack, released in July 2021. Apple introduced the Apple Smart Battery Case in December 2015. It entered the market as Apple&rsquo;s attempt at a portable and always-available alternative power source for the iPhone.</p>
<h2 id="are-charging-cases-safe-for-iphone">Are charging cases safe for iPhone?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#are-charging-cases-safe-for-iphone">#</a></h2>
<p>Answer: A: As long as the battery case you buy is Made for iPhone certified, it should be fine. I&rsquo;ve been using the mophie wireless charging battery case on my 7+ since I bought it and on my iPhone 6 for a year before that. Don&rsquo;t go cheap on anything that involves charging your phone.Jun 2, 2017</p>

<p>However, keeping the case on while your phone is charging might actually be doing harm to your battery. Heat is bad for batteries, and by leaving your phone case on while it charges you are trapping the heat that is being generated. Take your phone case off when you plug it in to give your phone a little fresh air.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you remove the phone&rsquo;s protective case while charging. It is natural for the battery to become slightly warm, but the case may act as a barrier and slow down heat dissipation. If possible, flip the phone over and place it on a soft cloth to protect the display.Nov 2, 2020</p>

<p>The Smart Battery Case was able to easily keep my iPhone XR charged at 100 percent for an entire day of rather heavy use. It effectively extends my phone&rsquo;s usable life to two days from one; once the case is tapped out, I can just remove it and rely on the XR&rsquo;s internal battery.Feb 1, 2019</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let your Smart Battery Case overheat. But, on the other end of the spectrum, a Smart Battery Case could theoretically cause battery damage — but not for the reasons that you think. It comes down to overheating, which definitely can damage a battery and reduce its overall capacity faster than normal.Mar 21, 2019</p>
