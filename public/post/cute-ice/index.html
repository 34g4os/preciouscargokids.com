                CHILL ALL DRINKS: The large 2.5  sphere size is perfect for your favorite low- or highball glasses. Globes chill drinks quickly without melting for a long-lasting, refreshing drink. KEEP DRINKS COLD LONGER: Avoid watery drinks by using these large, slow-melting cubes to chill your drink. Large cubes melt slowly to prevent diluting drinks, and ice may last long enough to pour another beverage over it. TIGHT-FITTING LID: Tight-fitting lid seals out odors and allows stacking. Lid creates a seal by fitting into the lip of silicone, and the stable base fits perfectly on top of another tray’s lid, so you can stack multiple silicone ice trays. CREATE SOPHISTICATED COCKTAILS: Create spherical ice for a distinctive, unique look for your favorite cocktails. Also great for iced tea, cold brew coffee, soda, lemonade, punch, and more. ENJOY WITHOUT WORRY: The sturdy plastic construction, leak proof design, and water fill line make this ice tray easy to use for anyone. The durable, food-grade molds are BPA-free and dishwasher-safe for the best possible user experience.

<p>Have you wondered why this is or have you had trouble connecting your dryer to your home electrical dryer outlet because they don&rsquo;t match? The old style of 3-prong dryer cords did not include a ground wire. Changes in the National Electrical Code now require dryers to be wired with a ground wire.Apr 19, 2019</p>

<p>Black is L1 or line one. White is neutral. And red is L2 or line two. The center wire on the three-wire cord is neutral and will always be installed in the center of the terminal block.Aug 14, 2020</p>

<p>Hold a three-prong 220 plug facing away from you with the two slanted prongs on top and the straight one on the bottom. Wrap the stripped end of the red, or hot, wire around the top left terminal and tighten the terminal screw firmly with all wire strands concealed under the screw head.</p>
