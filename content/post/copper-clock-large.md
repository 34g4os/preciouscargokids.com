## How do you hang a heavy clock without damaging a wall?
Adhesive Hooks For a heavier clock, use more than one hook in order to help share the load and spread out the weight evenly. Often they come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but a simple plastic or metal hook will do fine. You peel the protective paper from the back of the hook and then press it onto the wall.Dec 9, 2017

## What do you use to hang a wall clock?
We recommend using a screw instead of any type of hanger. Hanging the clock without a stud. A zip wall anchor is the easiest, yet the strongest way to go if you have to use your sheetrock and cannot find a stud (studs are best to use).Oct 7, 2010
