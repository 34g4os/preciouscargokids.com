## What is the front end of a bike called?
It is your "dashboard". Stem: The stem links the front wheel to the handlebar. The handlebar, stem, and front fork (which holds the front wheel) are not part of the bicycle "frame".

## Which is better long stem or short stem?
Using a shorter stem gives the bike quicker handling characteristics and a more responsive feel. A longer stem shifts your body weight towards the front of the bike and puts you in a better pedaling position, especially on those steep climbs.Oct 9, 2019

## Is a longer stem more stable?
“The longer the stem,” explains Tom Kellogg, “the more the rider's weight pushing forward on the bars tends to keep the front wheel pointing forward.” As a consequence, the bike becomes more stable, especially at high speeds, which accounts to some extent why pro riders normally opt for a shorter frame and a longer ...Mar 30, 2015

## How much difference does stem length make?
Stem length is one of a number of factors, along with head tube angle and fork rake, that affects a bike's handling. Generally speaking, a shorter stem will result in faster handling, while a longer stem will result in slower, more predictable handling.Feb 27, 2022

## Does stem length affect power?
When seated, a longer stem helps lengthen the rider reach, putting the upper body in a lower more aerodynamics position. Moreover, a longer stem would normally put the rider lower for improved aerodynamics and farther ahead of the bottom bracket when sprinting a body position that generates more power.

## What is the ideal stem length?
Stem length Mountain bike stems are typically around 50-80mm long, while road bike stems are longer, starting at around 80mm and extending to 120mm or longer as the frame size increases.Feb 27, 2022

## What stem length is too short?
To put a (rough) number to it, a long stem is 100-120mm, very long stems are 130mm or more, and anything less than 90mm can be considered a short stem.Mar 30, 2015

## What size stem should I have?
As a rule of thumb, on a road bike you shouldn't run a stem much shorter than 90mm or much longer than 130mm. If you need a stem length beyond those extremes, your bike frame is the wrong size.Jun 22, 2015
