Over time the gears start weaing out and the valve is not able to rotate anymore. Another common problem could be the motor going bad. 🛡️ INSTALL WITH EASE: After making sure the valve actuator is malfunctioning, remove the 4 screws holding it in place. When installing the new one make sure the valve switch is not off and make sure the valve is locked. If it is not locked then the valve actuator will rotate in 360 degrees. 💰 EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY: These aftermarket replacement parts for Pentair, Hayward, and Jandy Zodiac are made by Swimables and are of the same or better quality compared to the originals parts.

## Can you manually turn Jandy valve?
Well-known member. You can simply move the valve using the toggle switch if the limits provide full movement. When it is in the correct position, return the toggle to the middle position. Leave it there until you work is done than put toggle back in original position so valve will return to normal running position.Jul 1, 2020
