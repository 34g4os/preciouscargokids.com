## Are fat tire bikes easier to ride?
Fat bikes are surprisingly easy to ride and our customers couldn't agree more. After someone test rides a Drftless for the first time, they usually say, I was surprised at how easy it rides. The large tires provide more balance and control, which gives a beginner rider the confidence to seek more adventure.Nov 22, 2016

## Are fat bikes good for long rides?
The sort answer is yes, but it really depends on the type of touring you have planned. Fat Bikes make great bikepacking bikes and touring bikes on terrain that is really difficult to ride on normal bikes. Like sand or snow. They are best for sand riding, so riding in a dessert or in the snow.Jun 17, 2021

## How much harder is it to ride a fat bike?
Takes a Minimal Toll on the Body One thing that makes the fat bike great is that it isn't too hard on the body. Even when you're older and no longer have the strength and endurance you used to, a fat bike can still allow you to exercise without feeling pain or discomfort.Mar 16, 2021

## Are fat tire bikes slower?
They are meant to be able to go anywhere at a moments notice. You're probably not going to be winning any crit road races on one, but Fat Bikes are definitely not the slow, lumbering behemoths that many think them to be. “Aren't those bike really heavy?” They can be, but they can also be extremely lightweight.

If you try to put small tires on your fat bike wheels your bike will be too low to the ground and you will hit your cranks constantly... so go up to the 27.5 or 29er size wheel and this brings the bike back up to where it should be with plus size tires which are 3.0 or 3.25" width.

## Can I put 27.5 wheels on a 26 fat bike?
26 v 27.5 Fat Bike Wheels Summary Now many fat bikes come with 27.5, some with 26, and some will accommodate both sizes. Unless you experience persistent powder conditions or plan on riding year-round in dry conditions, wheel size should not be a make-or-break consideration.Jan 6, 2021

## Can wider tires fit on same bike wheel?
