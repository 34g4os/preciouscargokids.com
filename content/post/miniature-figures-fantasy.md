## What is a life cast made of?
Types of lifecasting materials include; plaster, alginate, silicone, and sometimes even waxes. In this case, we will be making a mold of a hand using silicone and a plaster bandage mother mold.

## What material do you use to cast?
Casts come in many shapes and sizes, but the two most common types of cast material used are plaster and fiberglass. While casts can be uncomfortable and cumbersome, they are an effective and efficient method to treat fractures.Jun 7, 2020

Alja-Safe® Crystalline Silica-Free Alginate is suitable for making temporary molds of the face, hands and other body parts.
