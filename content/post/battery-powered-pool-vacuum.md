## How do I get dirt out of my pool without a vacuum?
A nylon or rubber brush is the correct choice for scrubbing the sides of a soft-sided above-ground pool. A large pool brush makes quick work of the job, but you may need a smaller brush to clean corners. Once the particles have been removed from the sides of the pool, turn your filter back on and agitate the water.

## Is there a way to vacuum pool without pump?
A skim vac (or vacuum plate) allows you to use the skimmer basket instead of the pump strainer basket, eliminating the need to turn the pool pump on and off.

## Do handheld pool vacuums work?
Compared to automatic pool vacuums, handheld pool vacuums are much more affordable than their fancier, robotic counterparts. If you need a pool cleaner that won't break the bank, handheld is definitely the way to go. More powerful. Some handheld pool vacuums can deliver higher suction power than automatic pool vacuums.

## What is the advantage of using a robotic pool cleaner?
Environmental friendliness: Robotic pool cleaners are energy-efficient, which makes them much more environmentally friendly than other traditional options. Plus, a cleaner pool requires fewer chemicals, which benefits not just your family but also the environment.

## How long do robotic pool cleaners last?
Generally, you can expect at least 5 years' service from your quality robotic pool cleaner. The more expensive units are generally better quality – you do get what you pay for. If you keep your robotic pool cleaner in good condition, there is no reason it shouldn't last much longer.

## Do you need a robot pool cleaner?
Not only does a robotic cleaner help you with pool cleanliness, it also helps circulate water, guaranteeing a fresher swim. For these extra benefits, there is of course a price. Robotic cleaners are the most expensive type of pool cleaner there is, which does mean there is a higher price tag.Dec 6, 2018

## Can I leave robotic pool cleaner in pool?
You can swim while your bot cleans the pool, but it's better not to. Swimming churns up the water. If the machine is in the water at the time, the current will buffet it, making it harder for it to complete its work. It'll have to work harder to cover the same ground.
