## What is the most difficult jump stunt in cheerleading?
Pike This jump is among the most difficult of jumps. Both legs are straight out, knees locked. Arms are in a touchdown motion out in front to create a folded position in the air, this motion is also called "candlesticks".

## What is the best position in cheer?
It's no surprise why flyers are the most popular position in cheerleading! Since these cheerleaders will be required to perform various stunts (oftentimes up in the air), they mustn't be afraid of heights.

## What is the easiest cheer position?
Flyers

## What is the easiest stunt in cheerleading?
Probably one of the easiest and most common stunts is the shoulder sit. This stunt requires three people: a base, spotter and flyer. The base lunges with her right leg to the side at a 90-degree angle.

## Can I be a flyer in cheerleading?
But cheerleading is a team sport and each position on a squad has its importance. No flyer can go up or come down safely without bases or spotters. And although weight and height might play a part in what role you fill on a team, it is your ability and skill that should ultimately determine your position.Jan 22, 2019

## How much do u have to weigh to be a flyer in cheerleading?
the girls on the ground here are the same size as the ones in the air. some flyers are taller (and maybe more muscular) than the bases and vice versa. you do not need to be 4'7" and 70 pounds to fly (though you can be) and 5'6" or taller and 120 lbs to base/backspot.Nov 20, 2012

## What are the requirements to be a flyer in cheerleading?
All flyers need to have body control, balance, flexibility, and strength. In elite programs, flyers must be able to pull three different body positions, a full down from extended one-legged stunts, and a double down from prep level.

## How light are Flyers cheerleading?
As already mentioned, a flyer needs to be agile and needs to be of a much lighter weight than the base. The base must be able to throw the flyer in the air, sustain the stunts in the air and then catch the flyer on the way back to the ground. Thus the weight of a flyer can vary between 85 lbs to 115 lbs.Jan 16, 2021

## What are the requirements for being a flyer?
Flyers are expected to have fully extended scorpions, scales, heel stretches, bow and arrows and needles all while standing on the hands of a few people 10 feet in the air. They have to execute all these elements with the proper timing, technique and performance with no fear.

## Do you have to be flexible to be a flyer?
If you want to be a flyer, get ready to stretch, stretch, and then stretch some more! It's great to be in the spotlight, but that position is coveted and must be earned. Because flyers must hit several body positions in the air that require extreme flexibility, it's important to limber up.May 25, 2016
