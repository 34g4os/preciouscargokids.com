By delivering stable pulses to the skin to stimulate nerve fibers, Tens unit could effectively block the pain signal to people’s brain. At the same times, increases natural endorphins, which is a natural pain reliever. In many cases, the reduction or elimination of pain lasts longer than the actual period of stimulation EMS: “Electrical Muscle Stimulation” is an internationally accepted and way of treating muscular injuries. It works by sending electronic pulses to the muscle needing treatment; this causes the muscle to exercise passively. When the muscle receives this signal it contracts as if the brain has sent the signal itself. As the signal strength increases, the muscle flexes as in physical exercise. Then when the pulse ceases, the muscle relaxes and the cycle starts over again. iStim EV-805: Rechargeable Digital TENS EMS combo stimulator comes with 4 channels, 5 TENS modes, 3 EMS modes and 24 preset programs, sending comfortable impulses through the skin that stimulate the nerve fibers in the treatment area.

EMS therapy creates steady electric impulses that stimulate muscle contractions--many of them over a sustained therapy session. This repetitive contracting and relaxing of the muscle has the effect of: Increasing circulation (blood flow) to the affected tissue area, which aids in repair.Apr 25, 2017

## Can you control muscles with electricity?
Electrical muscle stimulation, aka e-stim or electrostim, is an adjunct physical therapy modality often used to reignite muscles' ability to contract.
