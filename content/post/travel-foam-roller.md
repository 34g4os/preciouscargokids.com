description="【FITS IN YOUR EVERYDAY BAG SO YOU CAN ROLL MORE OFTEN】Your body and mind are your greatest assets. Regular foam rolling has been proven to have huge benefits on both. With the world’s first truly portable roller, you can manage pain and speed your recovery no matter where you are. ROLL MORE, FEEL BETTER, and CONQUER THE DAY with your Morph! 【NOT MADE IN CHINA】 We get it, $69 may seem like a lot to spend on a foam roller, but The Morph is not your typical roller. It takes a team of European craftsmen (and craftswomen) nearly an hour to assemble over 60 individual pieces into this one of a kind FOLD FLAT mobility tool (no drain pipes covered in foam here). The result is the most convenient and usable roller on the market… making it the most effective foam roller available. 【AS EASY AS PULL AND PUSH】 With a quick tug on the easy pull ropes, your Morph will expand into a full size, 5.5” diameter muscle roller. It’s 14.5” long so it will span across your entire back. When you’re finished, push firmly on the disks at the end of the roller and it will collapse back down. It’s now ready to be stashed back into your daily bag. Collapse. Stash. Go. 【PORTABLE, STURDY, AND KINDER TO THE ENVIRONMENT】 The Morph Bravo weighs in at only 1.5 lbs and collapses down to less than 2 inches thick (slimmer than two folded shirts). But don’t let the slender form fool you, The Morph has been tested to support up to 350 lbs. Science! With a form factor that small, there s no reason to leave recovery and mobility training at home. MADE WITH BAMBOO AND RECYCLABLE ALUMINUM. One Roller Per Purchase. AS SEEN ON SHARK TANK. 【VERSATILE FOR ALL ATHLETES】 Loved by runners , Cross fit athletes , yoga and Pilates students , swimmers , physical or sports therapy patients. Great for the arch of the foot , and any part of the body but the spine or neck."

## Can you do damage with a foam roller?
Improperly putting pressure on the body with a foam roller can also cause damage, worsening pain or mobility issues. If you do foam roll, maximize the benefits by focusing on specific muscle groups using light pressure, and steer clear of potential risky moves like rolling the spine or IT band, he said.Nov 23, 2021

## Can foam rolling make things worse?
So, when you foam roll the IT Band, you are causing more inflammation on the nerve, thus causing more pain and slowing down the process of healing. And you certainly can not “stretch it” or “break up the knots.”

## Can foam roller cause nerve damage?
If you place sustained pressure on one body part, you might actually hit a nerve or damage the tissue, which can cause bruising, according to Monica Vazquez, NASM certified personal trainer and USA Track and Field Running Coach. The fix: “Spend 20 seconds on each tender spot then move on,” Vazquez recommends.May 1, 2014

## Is it okay to use a foam roller everyday?
"Foam rolling daily is safe, and for people who exercise regularly, it is probably a good idea," Dr. Berkoff says, adding that "there is no consensus on how often, how long and how hard to foam roll." Dr.Dec 26, 2020

## Can foam rolling damage muscles?
While there's some evidence that foam rolling can help reduce muscle inflammation and soreness, many purported benefits go beyond what science supports, Cottle said. Improperly putting pressure on the body with a foam roller can also cause damage, worsening pain or mobility issues.Nov 23, 2021

## Does foam rolling have any negative effects?
There are certain conditions and circumstances where use of a foam roller could be detrimental or damaging to a person's body. Foam rolling exercises load and stress the underlying tissues, including nerves, skin receptors, blood and lymphatic vessels, as well as bones.

## Why do I feel worse after foam rolling?
If you're unusually sore the day after foam rolling, you may have foam rolled too long or too aggressively. Make sure you aren't foam rolling a particular muscle group longer than two minutes, which may mean setting a timer to help keep you from overdoing it.Jul 21, 2020

## What muscles should you not foam roll?
There are many tools to perform self-myofascial release, but if you're using a foam roller, it will be important to only target dense areas of muscle tissue such as the calves, hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteals. Areas to avoid with the foam roller include the abdomen, low-back, chest (for women) and the neck.

## Can foam rolling make your back worse?
Why It's Bad: Placing a foam roller beneath your lumbar spine (your lower back) or neck can cause strain and hyperextension, says Justin Russ, C.S.C.S., a strength and conditioning coach and TriggerPoint master trainer in Florida.Oct 3, 2016

## Why shouldn't you foam roll your lower back?
A foam roller is a way to release muscle tension in the lower back; however, it's important to avoid putting too much pressure directly on your lower back muscles. If you're experiencing low back pain, the cause may be from tight muscles or muscle knots in another part of your body.Feb 24, 2022

## Can foam rolling be harmful?
Is foam rolling safe? Foam rolling is generally considered safe to do if you experience muscle tightness or regularly exercise. But avoid foam rolling if you have a serious injury such as a muscle tear or break, unless your doctor or a physical therapist has cleared you first.Apr 11, 2019

## What are 2 areas of your body you should avoid while foam rolling?
Avoid rolling directly on bones, joints, and connective tissue.

## Why you shouldn't use a foam roller?

"Foam rolling daily is safe, and for people who exercise regularly, it is probably a good idea," Dr. Berkoff says, adding that "there is no consensus on how often, how long and how hard to foam roll." Dr.Dec 26, 2020

## What happens if you foam roll every day?
Just like stretching, foam rolling can be integral to injury prevention, increasing blood flow, decreasing soft-tissue density and relaxing tight muscles. It also increases flexibility and can be helpful pre- and post-workout.Apr 22, 2019

## Can you foam roller too much?
Can you overdo foam rolling? When it comes to foam rolling, yes, you can overdo it. Excessively using a foam roller on a specific area can increase injuries and leave you in more pain. Instead, limit foam rolling to 30 to 90 seconds per muscle group and include 10 seconds of stretching in between each roll.Feb 24, 2021

## How often should you foam roll a day?
I would suggest a frequency of 2-3 times per week is usually adequate in most cases but you can increase this to as much as 3 times per day providing it isn't increasing your pain levels and you make this change gradually.Aug 30, 2012

## How long should you roll on a foam roller?
Foam roll each muscle group for about one minute, making sure not to exceed two minutes on a particular muscle group. As you're foam rolling, make sure the muscle you're targeting is extended and in a stretch. Your pace while foam rolling matters less than making sure you're rolling through the entire muscle.Jul 21, 2020
