## What fabric keeps you cool while sleeping?
Some materials, like linen, cotton, and lyocell (including Tencel), are more breathable and moisture-wicking than others, which makes them popular choices for cooling sheets. The weave of the fabric further affects its feel, breathability, appearance, and more.

## Is cotton the coolest fabric to sleep in?
Another study conducted in a warmer climate found that adults wearing Merino wool sleepwear (4) fell asleep faster than those wearing polyester.

## What is the best pajama material for night sweats?
Linen, cotton, and wool are optimal choices for those with overheating issues, as they're more breathable than other synthetic fabrics.

## What is the best fabric for hot flashes?
One of the first lines of defense against hot flashes at work is proper attire. Avoid wool, silk, and most synthetic fabrics. These materials trap heat and can increase your body temperature. Clothes made of cotton, linen, or rayon “breathe” better, release heat, and help keep you cooler.
