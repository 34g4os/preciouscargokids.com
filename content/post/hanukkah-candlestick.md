## Why do some menorahs have 7 and some 9?
A menorah, which has only seven candleholders, was the lamp used in the ancient holy temple in Jerusalem — now a symbol of Judaism and an emblem of Israel. A Hanukkiah, however, has nine candlesticks — one for each night of Hanukkah and an extra one to light the others.Dec 20, 2011

## What is a 7 branch menorah used for?
Since biblical times, the seven-branched menorah has symbolized Judaism. It first appears in Exodus, as a lighting fixture within the Tabernacle, a sort of portable temple used by the Israelites during their desert wanderings. The menorah is described in Exodus in minute detail, based on a heavenly prototype.Dec 16, 2016

## What do the 7 candles represent in Hanukkah?
The seven lamps depict the branches of human knowledge that are represented by six lamps inclined inwards towards, guided by, the light of God which is represented by the central lamp. The menorah also symbolises the creation in seven days, centre light representing the Sabbath.Dec 7, 2020

## What does each day of Hanukkah mean?
To their surprise, the menorah stayed lit for eight days, which was seven more days than they expected. The Jewish people attributed the surprising amount of time that the oil lasted to God (a miracle). Hanukkah is an eight-day celebration, and each day commemorates each day that the oil lasted.

## What does the 8th night of Hanukkah represent?
The last day of Hanukkah is the eighth day of Hanukkah. It is known as Zose Hanukkah, Zos Hanukkah or Zot Hanukkah. It marks the day on which the great miracle of oil occurred, according to Jewish belief. It is a particularly special day because it encapsulates all of Hanukkah.

## What does the 9 candle menorah symbolize?
Eight of the nine branches hold lights (candles or oil lamps) that symbolize the eight nights of the holiday; on each night, one more light is lit than the previous night, until on the final night all eight branches are ignited.

## What are Hanukkah candle holders called?
menorah

## What do you call the lighting candle of menorah?
Step 3: Light the Shamash The candle that is raised or in the center of the menorah is the shamash (helper candle). It's the one you use to light the other candles. Light it first. (Don't use any of the other candles to light the others.)
