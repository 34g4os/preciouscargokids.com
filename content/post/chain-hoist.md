## What are the equipment used in hoisting?
Hoisting equipment like jacks, pulleys, hand trolleys, hoists, power hoist, various types of cranes and elevators.

## Is a chain hoist and a chain fall the same thing?
A chain hoist (known as a ''chain block'' / ''chain fall'' / ''block and tackle) is a mechanical device containing a hand chain and lifting chain. Typically used vertically, it raises or lowers a heavy material by pulling down on the hand chain.

## What is a chain fall hoist?
Manual chain hoists lift and maneuver heavy loads short distances without the need for power. Also known as chain falls, chain hoists move loads in industries like construction and manufacturing, where heavy equipment and items are lifted and lowered.

## What are the three types of chain hoists?
There are three types of chain hoists: air, manual, and electric. The manual one and the air one are designed with reduction gears, hook pivots, and swivels. Suspended by a top hook, or by a push or geared trolley, these devices move objects slowly and carefully while making height adjustments.May 18, 2022

## What is the difference of chain block and hoist?
Chain block is used to lift and lower heavy loads vertically, while lever hoist is used to pull and lift in both vertically and horizontally or multi-directional positions. Lever hoist is operated using one hand by cranking the handle/ lever forward or backward.

## What are the three types of chain hoists?
There are three types of chain hoists: air, manual, and electric. The manual one and the air one are designed with reduction gears, hook pivots, and swivels.

## What is a chain hoist?
Definition of chain hoist : a tackle employing an endless chain instead of a rope and operated especially in workshops from an overhead track for hoisting heavy weights.

## What is a chain pulley called?
A differential pulley —also called "Weston differential pulley", sometimes "differential hoist", "chain hoist", or colloquially "chain fall"— is used to manually lift very heavy objects like car engines.

## What is the difference between a chain fall and a chain hoist?
A manual chain hoist which looks like a metal block is called a chain block. Chain fall's are also referred to as Chain hoists. You will most likely hear all three of these terms in the lifting industry.
