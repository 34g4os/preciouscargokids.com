## What is the best algaecide for black algae?
Black algae is more likely to come back after an initial outbreak. Use Suncoast All in One Algaecide to prevent future algae breakouts. This is the best multi-purpose algaecide. It keeps your pool algae-free without foaming and contains a clarifier to keep your water sparkling.

## What kills algae immediately?
You can get rid of algae quickly by vacuuming and brushing your pool, balancing your pool's water chemistry, and then shocking and filtering your pool water. Just be thorough as you clean your pool surfaces. If you leave behind even a small number of algae spores, it won't be long before they regrow and bloom again.Jan 2, 2022

## How do I get rid of black spot algae in my pool?
- Give the Black Spot a brush with your pool broom or an algae brush to scrape the surface of the Black Spot. - Add stabilised granular chlorine, sprinkling it directly onto the Black Spot where possible (you may need to turn the pump off in order to get the water still enough to land the chlorine on the algae).

## What causes black algae in a pool?
Any algae, including black algae, tend to bloom in bodies of pool water with a high pH level, low chlorine, bad circulation and filtration and not enough chlorine. It will flourish in a warm pool with lots of sunny days. Because of its appearance, black algae look a little frightening.

## What kills algae fast?
Chlorine

## What kills black algae in pool?
Use granular chlorine to shock your pool water and kill off bacteria. Use three times the amount you'd normally use (about three pounds per 10,000 gallons of water). Shock your pool in the evening and make sure to let your pool filter run for at least 24 hours after you add the shock treatment.

## How do I get black algae off the bottom of my pool?
You can use a putty knife, a pumice stone, or even a hand-held wire brush to scrub the remaining black algae off the pool's surfaces. We like to use chlorine tablets because now only do they offer a scrubbing surface, you're also applying chlorine directly, which can start killing the bacteria while you scrub.Aug 12, 2020
