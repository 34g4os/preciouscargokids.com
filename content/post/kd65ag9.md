## Is Sony A8 same as A8H?
The A8 was Sony's entry-level OLED TV for 2020, known as the A8H in the US, and was released in May 2020.Jun 16, 2021

## Is Sony a9 better than A8?
The Sony A9F is slightly better than the Sony A8F. Both TVs have excellent dark room performance thanks to the OLED panel which can produce perfectly deep blacks. The A9F has better color volume and displays gradients better.

## What is the difference between Sony OLED A8 and a9?
The Sony A9G OLED is very similar overall to the Sony A8G, but is a bit better for gaming. The A9G has much lower input lag, and all four HDMI ports support the full bandwidth of HDMI 2.0. The A8G only supports ARC over HDMI, whereas the A9G supports eARC, which allows for new, higher quality audio formats.

## Which is better Sony A8H or A80J?
Our Verdict. The Sony A80J OLED replaces the Sony A8H OLED in 2021, and while the two perform similarly, the A80J has a few upgrades that give it a slight edge. The biggest is the addition of two HDMI 2.1 ports, which is great for PS5 or Xbox Series X owners, and the A80J also has VRR support.

## Is Sony AG9 worth it?
TechRadar Verdict The Sony A9G/AG9 is worthy of any AV lover's entertainment center thanks to its best-in-class upscaling, 4K picture processing and respectable gaming performance. But the lack of HDR10+ support will make enthusiasts wary.Jun 23, 2021

## Which is better Sony a8 or AG9?
Our Verdict. Overall, the Sony A8H OLED is slightly better than the Sony A9G OLED. They both perform very similarly, but the A8H can get a lot brighter, it has better out-of-the-box color accuracy, and its input lag is much lower.

## What year is the Sony A9G?
2019

## Is Sony A90J worth it?
Sony's A90J OLED TV is an expensive option that delivers the best picture of any TV we've tested. It's been our luxury pick since it hit the market in spring of 2021, and still offers an excellent picture in a striking design with solid sound and a Google TV smart interface.Mar 24, 2022

## Which is better Sony a8 or AG9?
Our Verdict. Overall, the Sony A8H OLED is slightly better than the Sony A9G OLED. They both perform very similarly, but the A8H can get a lot brighter, it has better out-of-the-box color accuracy, and its input lag is much lower.

## Is Sony A9G good for PS5?
The Sony Bravia A9G has a native refresh rate of 120 Hz, which means that it can display compatible PS5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S games at up to 120 frames per second.Dec 14, 2020

## Do you need a soundbar with Sony A9G?
And even compared to that upgrade, the A9G's built in sound fared well. So if you're not an audiophile, plan to use the TV in a bedroom, or were planning to go with a budget sound bar anyway, the A9G will get the job done. I'd still recommend an eArc equipped sound bar to maximize your experience.

## Is Sony A9G better than A9F?
Our Verdict. The Sony A9F and the Sony A9G have very similar performance. They have a very different design and different remote control. It's hard to notice any differences in performance when watching normal content.

## Is Sony A90J bright enough?
The Sony A90J has decent HDR brightness. It's better than most OLEDs we've tested thus far, although it doesn't come close to the brightest LED TVs like the Samsung QN90A QLED. Still, the overall brightness of scenes is on-target and can bring out most highlights.

## Is Sony A90J worth it over A80J?
The Sony A80J OLED and the Sony A90J OLED are very similar TVs overall, and both offer stunning picture quality in a premium, well-built package. That said, the A90J uses Sony's new heatsink technology, which allows it to get brighter in HDR, although the difference is relatively small.

## Does Sony A9G support Dolby Atmos?
A: Yes, it's support Netflix Dolby Atmos.

## Does Sony OLED have Dolby Atmos?
It features Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos as well. The new TV is HDMI 2.1 compatible and offers variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode and e-ARC along with 4K 120fps.Jun 18, 2021
