## How far apart do you plant forget-me-nots?
Forget Me Not Plant Propagation Sow seeds after all danger of frost. Cover lightly with 1/8″ of garden soil. Space them 4-5 inches apart and thin seedlings to 10″ apart. These perennial plants can be propagated by separating clumps of established plants.

## Do forget-me-nots spread?
The perennial forget-me-not flower spreads easily, freely self-seeding for more of the wildflower to grow and bloom in shady spots where the tiny seeds may fall. Forget-me-not flower care is minimal, as with most wildflowers. Forget-me-not plants grow best in a damp, shady area, but can adapt to full sun.May 16, 2022

## How many seeds are in each packet?
The packet holds about 100 seeds. Some seeds need special treatment prior to sowing them, but tomato and hot pepper seeds are not one of them, but others like the moonflower needs to be nicked before you plant them.Jan 26, 2021

## How many seed packets do I need?
Don't exceed three seeds per hole. If more than one germinates, snip off extras at the soil line also. This prevents disturbance of the seedling roots on the one you'll continue growing out when thinning. Don't add more than one large seed to a hole.Aug 14, 2021

## How many forget-me-nots are there?
Currently, there are 74 different species of forget-me-nots that can be found all over the world—and many of them are popular garden plants because they add a beautiful touch of color to your garden. Most of these flowers range in shade from pale blue to bright blue, but a few feature white or pink blooms.Apr 27, 2022

## How far apart should forget-me-nots be planted?
6-12 inches apart

## What is wildflower seed mix?
This favorite wildflower mix contains many of the most popular perennial wildflowers, including blue flax, perennial lupine, Mexican hat, gloriosa daisy, black eyed Susan, candytuft, gayfeather/blazing star, Maltese cross, and seven more beloved varieties!

## Can you just scatter wildflower seeds?
If it's a smaller area, you can simply spread the seed by hand. After spreading the seed, compress the seed into the soil. To allow the seeds full sunlight, do not cover them in any way. The better seed-to-soil contact, the better chance of germination.

## Do wildflower mixes work?
Hopkins emphasizes that wildflower seed mixes still give a great return on the dollar. You can expect a pound of seed to cover 4,000 to 5,000 square feet of earth. The biggest problem his customers report: The seed is so tiny that people tend to plant far too thickly.Feb 25, 2012

## How many seeds are in one container?
Sow seeds. It's best to add 2-3 seeds to each pot, in case one doesn't sprout. Use the crease of the seed packet or place seeds in a creased piece of paper to help direct the seeds where you want them to go.May 28, 2022

## How big is a packet of seeds?
Packets are full size, 3 ¼” wide x 4 ½” tall and contain our All Annual Big Color – Variety Seed Mix seeds.

## How many seeds are in a lettuce packet?
Lettuce seeds are extremely small. A single packet averages five hundred seeds, or each composite flower can produce 15-25 seeds. Having that many seeds allows you to plant little and often. Sow a row or small patch every 7 to 10 days throughout spring or fall.Apr 24, 2019

## How many seeds are in a sunflower packet?
About 12 seeds per packet.

## How many seeds do you plant from a packet?
In general, two to three seeds should be planted per hole. Seeds do not have 100% germination rates, so not every seed planted will sprout. Overseeding holes, cells, or pots will help ensure that the number of plants you desire will grow (or more!).

## Do you plant the entire seed packet?
Don't add more than one large seed to a hole. If you're attempting a specific number of plants or just want a fuller pot, plant the large seeds closer together. You can snip or pull out those that are too close. Remember, seedlings need good airflow around them to avoid damping off.Aug 14, 2021

## How do I calculate how many seeds I need?
Take the total number of inches available for the crop and divide by the in- row crop spacing. For instance, 120 in. divided by 1 in. per pea seed equals 120 pea seeds.

## How much area does a packet of seeds cover?
Our standard package of mixed seed is 28 grams, 1 oz. of seed, so count on this to cover 100 – 150 square feet, or simply put, an area of about 15′ x 10′. Our 1/4 lb-bag will cover 375 – 500 square feet, the 1/2 lb-bag covers 750-1000 square feet and a 1 lb-bag will cover 1,500-2,000 square feet.
