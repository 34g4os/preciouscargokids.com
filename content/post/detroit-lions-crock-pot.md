## How do you clean hermetic jars?
Wash jars in a dishwasher or by hand, using detergent and rinsing well. Clean jars should then be kept warm prior to filling.

## Can Mason jars break from heat?
Because they're made of glass, they're vulnerable to thermal shock. That's a fancy way of saying that, when exposed to drastic changes in temperature, they break. For that reason, you don't want to pour a bunch of boiling water into a cold mason jar. You'll want to heat it gradually beforehand.
