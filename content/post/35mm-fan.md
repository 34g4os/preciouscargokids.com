The most important thing to look for in a 35mm fan is the CFM (cubic feet per minute) rating. The higher the CFM rating, the more air the fan can move.

## What is the most common fan size?
120 mm

## How do you know what size fan to get?
Standing on a step ladder as needed, hold one end of a tape measure to the tip of a fan blade on a fully assembled fan. If the unit has an even number of ceiling fan blades, extend the tape measure to the end of the opposite blade and record the distance from tip to tip. This is the diameter.

## What is the smallest PC fan?
The Mighty Mini fans and blowers are world's smallest, thinnest, and lightest cooling fans and blowers, measuring between 8-30mm wide, and 2mm thin.Jul 1, 2016

## What is the standard PC fan size?
120mm

## Are all PC fan the same size?
120mm case fans tend to be the most popular size of fans in modern PC cases, but you will find many sizes such as 80mm, 92mm, 140mm, 200mm and beyond. Fan size is closely related to airflow, in that larger fans will push more air than smaller ones while running at the same RPM.Oct 23, 2013

## Is 1 fan enough for gaming PC?
But is 1 fan enough for a gaming PC? No. When considering adding extra fans to your computer, one will not be efficient. The minimum number of fans recommended is 2 – an intake and exhaust fan.

## Is a 52 inch fan too big for a 12x12 room?
The ALA recommends a 29- to 36-inch fan for a room up to 75 square feet, such as a bathroom; a 36- to 42-inch fan for a medium-size room up to 144 square feet; and a 50- to 54-inch fan for a room around 225 square feet; 54- and 60-inch or larger fans are available for larger spaces.Jun 30, 2007

## What size fan do I need for a 12x12 room?
42-inch

## Is higher RPM better for PC fans?
The more the better regardless of the RPM, blades, etc. It's how much air it moves.Mar 13, 2014

## Is 1000 RPM good for case fan?
The higher the RPM, the more noisier it is. It's also better for a cool build. A 1000rpm fan is a bit low, as most standard case fans are anywhere from 1400-1600rpm, and you'd use a 1000rpm fan for a non-intensive work or leisure computer.

## How does a 3-wire fan work?
In a 3-wire fan, first two wires are the power supply wires of the fan. The third wire, comes directly from the output of the built-in 'Hall Sensor' chip generates output pulses during the fan rotation. With the help of this third wire, a monitoring circuit can 'see' the rotation.

## Why does my cooling fan have 3 wires?
A three pin connector is basically power (5/12 volt), ground, and signal. The signal wire measures how fast the fan is moving without any controls for the fan speed. With this type, fan speed is typically controlled by increasing or decreasing the voltage over the power wire.Sep 20, 2016

## Can you run a 3-wire fan with 2 wires?
The 3 Pin fan will fit onto the 2 pin you just need to match the holes and the pins and see which two contacts make the fan function.Oct 17, 2011
