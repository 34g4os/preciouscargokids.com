Water-based inks like gel pens will bead up and wash off Rite in the Rain Paper. WATERPROOF NOTEBOOK COVER: Polydura material creates a tough but flexible outer shell. Whether you re needing a hiking journal, outfitting your police gear, starting a golf journal, or just keeping a shower notebook, the Polydura cover material will defend your field notes from scratches and stains.
