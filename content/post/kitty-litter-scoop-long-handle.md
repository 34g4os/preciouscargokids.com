## What happens if you don't scoop the litter box?
One of two things will happen: they'll go somewhere else, or they'll hold it in until the box is clean. If they do the latter, that can lead to some serious issues, like a UTI, bladder infection, or kidney problems. For humans, bladder issues are obnoxious, but not too serious. For cats, they're a big deal.May 20, 2018

## How often should you scoop a litterbox?
How Often Should You Change the Cat Litter? If you use a clumping litter, it's best to scoop the box daily and change it out completely at least monthly. If you have more than one cat, it may be best to change the cat litter more often, every 2-3 weeks.

## Is it OK to clean litter box once a week?
Typically, cat parents wash the box once a week. You can use dish soap and warm water or vinegar and water to clean the box. Don't use traditional bleach since it can interact with the ammonia in cat urine. Regular washing will prevent the plastic material of your litter box from absorbing cat odors.

## How many times should a cat use the litter box a day?
Some cats will ‚Äúhold it‚Äù and urinate as infrequently as possible to avoid stepping into a dirty, filthy, full litter box. Instead of urinating two to three times a day, your cat will tighten up and only go once a day.
