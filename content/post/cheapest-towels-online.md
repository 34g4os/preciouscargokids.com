## Is cotton best for towels?

Whether you need them for yourself or your guest bathroom, cotton bath towels are multitaskers and ideal for everyday use.

If you're wondering why your dish towels are not absorbent, it's usually due to a buildup of detergent or fabric softener.

For towels you've had a while, the laundry products you're using can have the same effect.May 12, 2020

## How can I make 100 cotton towels more absorbent?
Add 1 cup of plain white Vinegar, (not wine vinegar, cheap home brand is good) to the rinse cycle. If you have a top loader washer, dilute the vinegar first in a small bucket of water, or wait until the water level is high enough to dilute it instantly, or you may discolour your towels.Jan 8, 2021
