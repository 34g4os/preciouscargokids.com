## How long does a pendulum swing for?
The exact periods of your longer and shorter pendulums may be slightly less than 1.7 seconds and 1.2 seconds, respectively, because of friction and because their lengths were less than 70 cm and 35 cm (due to strings being used to tie to attachments).Feb 23, 2012

## Does a pendulum have perpetual motion?
The pendulum is not a perpetual motion machine. Because of air friction and gravity the pendulum would eventually stop swinging, but a magnet encircling the cable pulls on the cable with each swing. Electric current controlling the magnetism is turned on and off with each swing of the pendulum.

## Does a pendulum keep swinging?
If there were no friction or drag (air resistance), a pendulum would keep on moving forever. In reality, each swing sees friction and drag steal a bit more energy from the pendulum and it gradually comes to a halt. But even as it slows down, it keeps time.May 16, 2021

## Why did the pendulum eventually stop swinging?
The pendulum stops eventually because of air resistance. The pendulum loses energy because of friction. Only in a theoretical situation when there is no friction the pendulum will oscillate forever.

## What happens to energy when pendulum stops?
When the pendulum stops briefly at the top of its swing, the kinetic energy is zero, and all the energy of the system is in potential energy. When the pendulum swings back down, the potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy.Sep 21, 2020

## What energy is wasted in a pendulum?
When the pendulum is at position B, all of its potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy and it is moving at its maximum speed. When the pendulum reaches position C, it has regained half of its potential energy and lost half of its kinetic energy.Sep 24, 2019

## Do pendulums lose momentum?
Momentum of the pendulum is not conserved, because it is constantly changing during the flight of the pendulum.Apr 24, 2010

## What is the Speciality of a pendulum clock?
A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element. The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is a harmonic oscillator: It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates.
