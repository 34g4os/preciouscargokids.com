## How do you open a number lock without the code?
To open combination locks without a code, start by pulling up on the dial and turning it clockwise until you hear the lock click. Then, check what number you're at, add 5 to that number, and write it down. Next, set the dial to that number and turn it counterclockwise until you hear it click again.
